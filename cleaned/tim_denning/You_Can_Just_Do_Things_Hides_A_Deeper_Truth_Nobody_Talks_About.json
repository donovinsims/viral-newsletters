In his 20s, he saw this guy Vishen Lakhiani blow up online. He moved from Australia to Malaysia to work directly for him. Because he had no skills he took a sh*t kicker job right at the bottom.\n\nHe was a workhorse.\n\nWhile working for Vishen he met an American. They became friends. They worked stupid hours. They had no s*x for years while they worked their unconventional jobs. They knew nothing about digital marketing but were forced to learn on the job.\n\nVishen had no idea about their true inexperience.\n\nThey ran multi-million-dollar campaigns to an enormous audience and learned the coolest insights. Eventually, they quit their jobs and went out on their own.\n\nThey reached out to successful influencers and best-selling authors. Because they had zero clients, they used their success with Vishen as proof they could market anything. And it worked. They landed multiple 6-figure clients within months.\n\nBastards.\n\nTo get clients they hand-wrote short pitches to powerful people. They got good at getting around famous people’s assistants. At the height of their success they decided to part ways. Dave moved back to Australia. The other moved back to America.\n\nDave now had no money coming in. He had to start again. He had no audience of his own. So within a week, he found a friend running a big email list and worked out a deal where he could use her list to promote his new business. He skipped audience building altogether.\n\nThis little venture now supports his wife and two kids. They’ve done extremely well financially.\n\nThe other friends in my friend group are pissed off with Dave. They hate that he makes doing things look so easy. Recently, Dave wanted to lose weight. Within a day he got ChatGPT to write him a meal plan and found a personal trainer who agreed to train him for free.\n\nThe others in my friend group wait for the right time, overeducate with too many degrees, procrastinate, and have dreams instead of habits. They mistake just doing things for privilege or some other factor that must explain Dave’s results.\n\nDave and I bond because we’re alike.\n\nAt 19, I launched businesses. We raised money without knowing how to pitch investors or write up a pitch deck. I then got into banking with no finance degree or connections, and rose to (arguably) one of the coolest jobs in history.\n\nThat job required no job interview. And I met 0% of the job description (no joke). Then I permissionlessly became one of the most shared writers on the internet for the last 11 years with no published books or writing talent.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as “You can just do things.” The idea was popularised by writer Jay Yang who also works directly for Alex Hormozi.\n\nHe recently posted this odd cartoon (about just doing things) that went insanely viral:\n\nThe idea is picking up more traction each day. It seems obvious. But the meme of “you can just do things” hides a deeper truth few talk about.\n\nLet me break it down so you can use it to your advantage.\n\n---\n\nThe deeper truth that might just change your life is that “you can just do things” works because it prioritizes momentum.\n\nWhen you start small on a goal it’s easier to get moving. Then once you’re moving you have real data on what works and what doesn’t work through doing things. This is why even people with low to average IQ can achieve extraordinary results.\n\nThey don’t have time to overthink things. They just take action and expect they’ll figure it out along the way. And guess what? They do!\n\nThere’s an even deeper level to why just doing things works. Let me explain.\n\nEvery day I get sent random emails and DMs from strangers. There’s no message. Just a link to a Substack newsletter they wrote. It’s strange. I asked a writer friend of mine, Todd Brison, why this is happening.\n\n> “People are sending you links to their Substack because they’re hoping you’ll read it, then promote it for free to your millions of followers.”\n\n“People are sending you links to their Substack because they’re hoping you’ll read it, then promote it for free to your millions of followers.”\n\nWhat these people are subconsciously saying to me in their DM is “Look, my writing is f*cking brilliant and this one idea I wrote about will change your life.”\n\nOf course, 99.9% of these unsolicited DMs with Substack links never get opened. They just get deleted.\n\nHere’s what they misunderstand:\n\nGreat writing with perfect sentences doesn’t matter. And whatever idea they’re writing about has already been written about before.\n\nWhat matters is what’s behind the writing. It’s the story. That story is built when you just do things for long periods of time. That’s the novelty.\n\nThe story is crucial because of what writer George Mack says:\n\nWhen someone says they just did things every day for 11 years and didn’t ask questions… that’s not common. That’s a lot of work, a lot of stories, a lot of data.\n\nPeople respect the reps, not the idea.\n\n---\n\n“If you get in your head, you’re dead” said a wise man centuries ago.\n\nWhat he means is if you let overthinking, perfectionism, or “I’m not qualified enough” infect your brain, you’ll never get anywhere in life.\n\nThe human brain is wired for survival. At the first sign of friction or discomfort the brain will do its job and talk you out of whatever crazy task you’re asking it to do.\n\nYour brain wants you to stay the same.\n\nJust doing things is the antidote that overrides your human programming. Once you understand every goal in life is just YOU versus YOU + self-improvement in disguise… you can literally achieve any goal.\n\nThe conversation shouldn’t be “How do I get started?”\n\nIt should be “How would I have to think to make this goal happen? What would I have to believe?”\n\nNow you have the mindset. If you adopt the mindset, you get results and just do things. If you don’t, then you stay where you are.\n\nLife is now stupidly simple. No more guessing.\n\n---\n\nWhat works for me is…\n\nI act when I’m inspired. If I have a good idea or get a spark of courage, I act right away on it. While writing this essay I thought of Jay Yang. So I instantly sent him a DM to say hi because I felt inspired to.\n\nTomorrow I won’t have that same inspiration. I’ll be in my head and think to myself “When I get time” or “Jay probably doesn’t like me.”\n\nBut right now my mind is inspired and isn’t thinking in survival mode. So now is the best time for me to message Jay. And so I did.\n\nSame applies to writing. I often have ideas about what to write about. But when I sleep on a writing idea, it doesn’t feel as special or as good the following day. This is why I don’t sleep on essay ideas.\n\nI write an outline of an essay, or ideally the whole thing, the moment it pops into my head. That’s when the idea has the most energy & I have the most energy to act on it.\n\nI also move fast. I have a psychopathic sense of urgency caused by a near-miss with cancer in 2015. I’m not interested in tomorrow or next year. When people talk in those terms, I just politely switch off. Self-talk: “I might be dead then.”\n\nMoving fast is coupled with the fact I’m impatient. My wife always complains about it. I always want everything done now. My brain thinks “When would now be a good time to do it.”\n\nI used to think being impatient was bad.\n\nNow I see it as crucial. Impatience forces you to use tighter deadlines and forget about being perfect. The people I admire are impatient. They act faster than normal and learn faster because of it.\n\nWhen you act fast things break. I love it when that happens. I recently launched a new booking system for my business. The tech is imperfect. I had no clue if it would work. Instead of terrorising my brain, I just launched it. Within a day three people reported major bugs and I fixed it. Now it’s perfect.\n\nYou don’t learn unless you break things.\n\nAnd whatever worst-case scenario you’re thinking of, it’s almost never going to happen. People are forgiving. And the people who aren’t forgiving are often rude a**holes hiding in plain sight, virtue signalling their butts off to fit in.\n\nRudeness is a huge red flag.\n\nIf you want to test anyone, take them to a cafe. Purposely get the waiter to stuff up the order. Notice how they treat the waiter. Now you know everything about them.\n\nAs we keep moving through the just do things framework, we get to the need for certainty. Just doing things makes the world very uncertain.\n\nYou end up acting with less than ideal facts or data. You back yourself when no one else will. And more chaos may happen as a result of imperfection and fewer plans. Most people can’t deal with uncertainty.\n\nThey label uncertainty as “this feels bad.”\n\nSo they do everything they can to avoid uncertainty and choose paths full of certainty. It’s why college degrees used to be a popular path. The outcome was certain. You study an MBA and you end up as a titan of a business. All you have to do is follow the 12 steps the professor lays out and comply with them.\n\nAnyone with high agency knows that certainty is a myth. The predictable career path of a degree or a working a safe job can blow up in seconds.\n\nOne death in the family. One health diagnosis. One layoff. One recession. One foreign war. That’s all it takes for your perfect plans and certainty to get f*cked in the butt by entropy.\n\nCertainty is an illusion. It never existed.\n\nFrom here, once you accept certainty is harming you, it leads you to know that there’s never the right time to do anything. I feel that right now. I have a second baby daughter coming in 4 weeks. Now is the worst time for me to do anything. I must act knowing in 4 weeks my life will be utter chaos.\n\nA 3 year old and a newborn baby under one roof while I’m trying to work from home is a formula for disaster. I can either:\n\n1. Shut down my life (the option most will take)\n2. Admit there’s never a right time to do anything and just keep doing things.\n\nShut down my life (the option most will take)\n\nAdmit there’s never a right time to do anything and just keep doing things.\n\nI’ve chosen option one. It’s been a fun ride guys. Thanks for reading. I’ll see you in 5 years when the chaos has subsided. Have a nice life. Just freaking joking!!!\n\nThere’s literally never a time in life when you won’t be busy. Just ask my parents. They’re retired and have never been busier. They have back-to-back social appointments, funerals to attend, and elderly family to take care of.\n\nThe only time life isn’t busy is when you’re dead. If you get good at just doing things when the timing isn’t right, you’ll be a f*cking superstar with perfect titties when the timing is bang on. Hubba hubba.\n\n---\n\nThe deepest truth about just doing things is it creates momentum, which means you end up acting with momentum on your side. That’s a powerful place to be.\n\nIt can make a lot of rejections, failures, and problems vanish.\n\nThe visual I’ll give you is that most people try and plan out the entire 10,000 steps to their goal in advance and want to know what every step will look like. The just doing things crowd doesn’t do that. Nope.\n\nThey focus on putting one foot in front of the other. They take small steps in a power walking fashion. They stay alert. They expect hills. They know the directions may change. And most of all, they love the journey because that’s what writes cool stories they can one day tell their grandkids.\n\n“You can just do things” is an idea that I promise will change your life. Use it.\n\nWhen did “waiting until you’re ready” become the socially acceptable way to procrastinate?\n\n---\n\nP.S. I’ve just opened enrollment for my private coaching group - Fearless Money Makers\n\nLast one of the year.\n\nIn Fearless Money Makers, we help you:\n\n* Start or scale your digital business\n* Work fewer hours each day & keep 90% profit margins\n* Achieve true financial & personal independence\n\nStart or scale your digital business\n\nWork fewer hours each day & keep 90% profit margins\n\nAchieve true financial & personal independence\n\nThe only “catch.”\n\nYou have to apply.\n\n(I figure if you can’t take 2 minutes to fill out the application, you won’t have the attention span to scale a digital business anyway.)\n\nHere’s the link to fill out the application now"
