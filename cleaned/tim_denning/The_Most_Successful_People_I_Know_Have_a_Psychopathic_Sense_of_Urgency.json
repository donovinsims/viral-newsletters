The speed at which I can build something from nothing is unheard of.\n\nIt started in my 20s. My older brother was painfully impatient. He always wanted everything right now. As a toddler he’d take his toy plastic car and ride it to the shops.\n\nMy parents couldn’t keep the little bastard in the backyard.\n\nWhen we built a business together in our 20s his weird sense of urgency rubbed off on me. We built a new business from scratch to 8 figures and 100 employees in under a year. The level of execution was borderline insanity.\n\nUntil recently, I’d forgotten why. Then I remembered.\n\nOur mindset at the time was if we worked hard for a year or two and built a successful business, we could spend the rest of our lives doing whatever we wanted.\n\nNow I’m older I see the flaws in this worldview… but it’s true to a degree.\n\nWhat my brother and I built wasn’t perfect, but it did completely rewire my brain. I realized what author Jay Yang recently made popular: you can just do things. And when you do things with a psychopathic sense of urgency, big things happen.\n\nThings you could never dream of. Results that seem like millionaire clickbait.\n\nThis mindset I got from my brother is life-changing. Here’s how to implement it in your life so you can reach financial freedom, faster.\n\nThe greatest muscle you can build is urgency. Decrease the time between having an idea and getting it done. Everything changes – Codie Sanchez\n\n# “Let's also prioritize balance and well-being to avoid burnout. Finding that sweet spot can be key.”\n\n(Anonymous X user)\n\nWhen I saw this comment on my X post it made me realize what having psychopathic urgency isn’t.\n\nThe p0rn fantasies of balance and well-being are the reason most people never get what they want in life. The gurus say “find the sweet spot.”\n\nThere is none.\n\nYou either chase your one big goal with everything you’ve got, or nothing will happen. Trying to be balanced is what’s wrong with society.\n\nSuccess in any field comes from IMBALANCE.\n\nYou can’t have what you want and also be as cool as Nathan Apodaca riding his skateboard down the road drinking cranberry juice listening to Fleetwood Mac while filming a TikTok.\n\nGetting what you want is harder than that.\n\nThen there’s burnout. The happy-go-lucky-f*cky LinkedIn influencers love to post about burnout as though it’s more dangerous than Chernobyl-levels of radiation.\n\nI agree with them, except burnout only happens when you work on something each day that you hate. And most people on LinkedIn hate their jobs, so it’s easy to see why they experience the feeling of burnout.\n\nBut when you exit the Dilbert-style cubicle olympics to nowhere, stop climbing the corporate ladder, and get your life together… burnout isn’t real anymore.\n\nI haven’t experienced burnout since I left my job 4 years ago. I’ve forgotten what it feels like. I can work 12 hours straight in a single day without leaving my office chair and feel nothing (I did this one day last week).\n\nDoesn’t mean you need to work crazy hours like that all the time – the point is that chaos and imbalance lead to better results than chilling like a homie wearing a hoodie and drinking cranberry juice.\n\nThe critics will then argue that having a psychopathic sense of urgency so you can succeed at something is a stupid pursuit. “Success won’t make you happy,” scream the Karens from the grocery aisle.\n\nWhat they’re misunderstanding is humans are purpose driven. When you succeed at something in life if gives you enormous purpose. That purpose makes your life feel like it’s worth something and has value.\n\nThe opposite is to have no purpose and end up settling for second best while the regrets quietly pile up in the background until you have breakdown. Now you know why modern life sucks for so many people. They innocently didn’t get this memo.\n\nThe other reason the gurus praise work-life balance and having no stress is because they’re afraid of hard work. I was too.\n\nWorking hard for a bank that saw me as a rounding error felt like death.\n\nBut when you work on a project where you have 100% ownership and control, hard work feels different.\n\nHard work only feels bad if it’s building someone else’s dream, not yours.\n\nThe most important thing in your career:\n\nSpeed.\n\nIf you answer emails fast, walk fast, talk fast, get sh*t done fast, you will make a lot of money. No sense of urgency, you won't. – Nick Huber\n\n# How to adopt a psychopathic sense of urgency, so you feel limitlessness\n\nA few small steps and mindset shifts.\n\n### Increase your rate of iteration\n\nNicolas Cole mind-f*cked me with this idea.\n\nI heard him share it on a podcast and it’s haunted me ever since. Your chances of failure increase astronomically if your rate of iteration is too slow.\n\nI’m building a business with my friend Todd. At one point we were only meeting once a week. We realized that meant we only made changes every 7 days.\n\nSo our progress turned into snail speed. Nothing could get done. Problems mounted. Solutions were rare.\n\nI channeled my inner Cole and realized our rate of iteration was too slow. So we started talking more often on Whatsapp and suddenly our progress exploded.\n\nMost people iterate too slowly. They don’t have enough experiments running. A/B testing is non-existent. They follow the same boring plan for far too long, even when it’s not getting them results. Fail.\n\nYou must have a psychopathic sense of urgency when it comes to iteration. If you don’t iterate your dreams die.\n\n10,000 iterations, not 10,000 hours.\n\n### Embrace the power of only doing one thing\n\nShiny object syndrome ruins more lives than Andrew Tate does.\n\nPeople have to-do lists, vision boards, and lists of goals. The problem is when you try and do many things you end up with no successful things.\n\nI see this with creators all the time. They’ll decide to start two or even three newsletters so each can be about a different topic. Because they’re working solo, they quickly find it doesn’t work.\n\nThere simply isn’t enough time or energy for you to succeed at many things. That’s why the top 1% are normally successful at only one thing, or in rare cases, successful at one thing at a time.\n\nWhen you realize how hard it is to be successful at anything, it changes how you think. You realize it’s one thing or nothing.\n\nPeople try to be successful at multiple goals when they make the mistake of not deciding. Instead of choosing, they try to do them all.\n\n### Replace your decision-making framework\n\nIt’s easy to fail in life if you have a bad decision framework. Here’s the only one you need…\n\nIf you’re trying to make a decision and there’s Option A and Option B, the only wrong decision is not to choose A or B. As long as you decide on something, you will make progress. It’s NOT deciding that’s the kiss of death, and this is how most people live.\n\nThey put off decisions. They stay stuck in indecision which feels like being Indiana Jones walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nOnce you get better at making decisions, it’s easier to move forward with a psychopathic sense of urgency.\n\n### Turn tomorrow into today\n\nThis one is subtle.\n\nThe difference between doing something today or tomorrow doesn’t feel that radical to most of us. But the difference of 24 hours changes when you compound how much more progress you get when you move actions to today instead of tomorrow.\n\nThe challenge of delaying something until tomorrow is we lie to ourselves. We say tomorrow but it’s easy for that to become the day after, month after, and year after.\n\nDelaying action creeps up on us until the boogie monster shows up at our door to rip our heads off for being lazy. Whenever you catch yourself saying “I’ll do it tomorrow,” interrupt that pattern and do it today.\n\n> Reframe: When would now be a good time? – Tony Robbins\n\nReframe: When would now be a good time? – Tony Robbins\n\n### “Should I even be doing it at all?”\n\nThis is the most common question I ask myself.\n\nIt’s easy to get caught in a psychological trap where you spend time on things and can’t even remember why. Regularly rejustifying what you spend time on is extremely helpful. I often find I said yes to an opportunity to please another person, or because at the time it made sense.\n\nWhen I ask myself “Should I even be doing it at all?” the answer is often no. This saves me a lot of time so I can have a sense of urgency toward the right objectives.\n\n### Don’t ever say “someday,” “next year,” or “one day”\n\nThese phrases made me a loser.\n\nI had to become a heavy drinker to cope with the daily existence these phrases led to. So I wasted 10 years in banking instead of building my dream. And I thought with my d*ck and hooked up with one-to-many women.\n\nOne day doesn’t exist.Next year doesn’t exist.Someday doesn’t exist.\n\nCancer rates are higher than ever. None of us is safe. A human life can be all over in a few months. During the 2020 bat virus I lost contact with a good friend I met at work. I just got busy and forgot to return her calls.\n\nWhen I finally did get time to call her she didn’t answer. One of her friends then sent me a Youtube video.\n\nIt was of her funeral.\n\nIn 90 days, she went from being a healthy 30-something year old about to start a family, to looking like death.\n\nShe filmed the 90 day transformation on Youtube. On day 1 you couldn’t tell. By day 7 the chemo had messed with her face, skin, and ability to talk. By day 89 she was saying “in the next few days I will be dead.”\n\nThe next day it happened (4 years ago).\n\nAfter she passed her friends set up a Facebook memorial page. Each day they would leave her messages they hoped she would read in the after-life. After a year the messages slowed down. In the second year there were two people still leaving messages. Now, 4 years on, no one leaves messages anymore.\n\nThat’s how fast a human life can fade. It’s a dark reminder.\n\nIf you’re not doing the thing today, it’s bullsh*t. Read that again.\n\n# Final Thought\n\nA lack of urgency is the #1 sign of failure.\n\nIt’s a lukewarm, piss-weak way to live that will only end in mental health issues and self-care retreats to a magic fairy mountain.\n\nTruly successful people are unreasonable enough to twist people to their insane timeframes. You see it time and time again. From Steve Jobs to crazy book deadlines set by authors like Tim Ferriss.\n\nAnything is possible with a psychopathic sense of urgency.\n\nIs having a sense of urgency important to you? Let me know in the comments below (I read every comment).\n\n---\n\nI send this email weekly.
