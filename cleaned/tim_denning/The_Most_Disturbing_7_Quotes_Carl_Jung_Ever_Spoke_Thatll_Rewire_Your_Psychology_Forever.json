He has more fans than Joe Rogan or the President of the United States.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nBecause his tiny quotes of wisdom will rewire your psychology forever if you pay attention. Our psychology determines how we think.\n\nIf you reprogram your psychology, everything in your life changes.\n\nCarl Jung has been doing that for years from the grave. But his advice is often deeply disturbing. It can even be offensive.\n\nHere are the most disturbing quotes from Carl Jung, and how to use them in your life.\n\n# 1. “What you resist not only persists but will grow in size.”\n\nWe’re brainwashed into being like everyone else.\n\nThe world can’t wait to tell you what to do and assign you generic labels that limit you. As you get older there’s a quiet voice in the back of your mind that tells you to stop resisting and do what you know you must do.\n\nMost of us ignore that voice out of fear.\n\nThis leads to another idea from Carl Jung:\n\n“Every human life contains a potential, if that potential is not fulfilled, then that life was wasted.”\n\nMost people aren’t depressed or unhappy. They’re pissed off on the inside because they know deep down they’re not living up to their potential. The more they resist their true calling the bigger the painful regrets grow.\n\nOnce you understand this your life is never the same again.\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nStop resisting.\n\nTake the risk. Do the scary thing. Leave the person behind. Start the business. Try to earn multiple streams of income doing something you give a sh*t about. Otherwise all you have is envy, regret, hate & anger that get bigger until eventually they destroy you.\n\nNow you know why normal people are so angry and love the news.\n\n---\n\n# 2. \"The world will ask you who you are, and if you do not know, the world will tell you.\"\n\nThe default path is a nightmare.\n\nIt leads people to live on auto-pilot and get told what to do, whether they realize it or not. Like it or not, this is how you become oppressed.\n\nThat’s why school, college, and corporations can’t wait to tell you what you should do.\n\nThey love to use fancy labels to describe you, so they can manipulate your next move to align with their incentives. This isn’t some evil conspiracy, it’s just capitalism 101. Incentives drive behavior.\n\nJust ask the management consultant who gets a promotion and 10% more money, only to realize that instead of working from 8 AM until 6 PM, they’ll now be working from 7 AM until midnight.\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nFigure out what you are going to do with your life. Experiment. Talk to people outside of your bubble. Learn from failures and rejection instead of gurus and empty advice.\n\nDo the thing you can’t stop thinking about, despite how it feels.\n\n---\n\n# 3. “I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.”\n\nI spent years as a victim.\n\nPsychologists gave me the mental illness label and I embraced it. I thought my life suddenly made sense. “This was out of my control,” I thought.\n\nSo then I felt free. For a few days. Until I realized if I was not in control of my life and the thoughts I had, then there was nowhere for me to go.\n\nI was broken beyond repair.\n\nBroken things go to the rubbish dump. Broken humans jump off bridges.\n\nThen I discovered this quote from Carl Jung, and mixed it with some philosophies from Tony Robbins. Suddenly I was in full control again.\n\nBad sh*t is always gonna happen, but what are you gonna do with it?\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nAll situations that happen to you come with a choice. Is this event going to empower you or destroy you? You get to decide.\n\nThere’s nothing better than an underdog making a comeback.\n\n---\n\n# 4. “The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm that is not easily disturbed.”\n\nI am chill as hell.\n\nThroughout life I’ve had some boulders thrown at me. Partners that cheated on me, nearly being murdered at 16, alcoholism, working in a strip club as a DJ, theft of $1.2M, driving a limo at 18 with dangerous drug dealers, multiple startup failures, being publicly fired and having to tell 200,000 people on LinkedIn.\n\nThese setbacks tell me I can deal with anything.\n\nEach failure or rejection has forced me to get on with it and make new decisions. In the process, I’ve made new friends and learned powerful strategies to destroy negativity.\n\nThey sit on the couch and watch other people live the life they should be living. Or they idolize heroes because they have no courage. They spend their time wishing and hoping something big will happen.\n\nBut when you get good at resolving conflicts, you unlock a limitless mind.\n\nNothing stands in your way anymore. No one’s opinion makes you give a flying f*ck. And critics are just free marketers for your way of life and multiple income streams.\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nThink back to the times you’ve failed or been rejected.\n\nSee these events as a source of strength. Let them give you the confidence that you can overcome hard things. And if you overcame that tragic event, then what other challenges might you be able to overcome?\n\nAnswer: anything.\n\n(Limitless mindset now unlocked.)\n\n---\n\n# 5. “The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it”\n\nA reader messaged me: “You’re an a-hole that can’t take feedback.”\n\nWe hadn’t interacted for 5 years. They were right. I told him, “Yes, 2019 Tim Denning was an a-hole … it’s a shame you don’t know 2024 me.”\n\nThe first half of my life was full of ego and status-chasing. Fast cars, chasing blonde chicks through nightclubs as a DJ, drinking until I passed out, and stupid banking job titles that meant nothing.\n\nAt 34 the second part of my life started. It’s the opposite. Ryan Holiday’s book “Ego is the Enemy” woke me up. I freaking hate big egos now. I run in the other direction when I encounter one.\n\nOnce you let go of your ego, reality looks different.\n\nHow you spend your time and energy transforms overnight. And suddenly your life, job, network, and content consumption change.\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nDitch ego-driven tasks and pursuits right now. Let the second part of your life start early, so you can experience true meaning.\n\n---\n\n# 6. \"You are what you do, not what you say you'll do.\"\n\nMediocrity exists when you think:\n\n* “I’ll do this someday.”\n* “I hope X will happen.”\n* “I’ve got that on my to-do list.”\n* “When things aren’t so busy I’ll get to it.”\n\n“I’ll do this someday.”\n\n“I hope X will happen.”\n\n“I’ve got that on my to-do list.”\n\n“When things aren’t so busy I’ll get to it.”\n\nAction is all that matters. I’ll go a step further: what you do today is all that matters. Because tomorrow doesn’t exist and you aren’t guaranteed more alive time. Cancer rates are skyrocketing out of control.\n\n> What makes you think you’re too special for cancer?\n\nWhat makes you think you’re too special for cancer?\n\nI wasn’t.\n\nThe cliche quote, “Yesterday you said tomorrow” applies here. Actions show people who you are, and everything else is a distraction that makes you a liar.\n\nLiars are perpetually broke.\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nLook at your to-do list. Delete 90% of it. Then act today on what’s left. Create a sense of urgency. Live as if tomorrow doesn’t exist.\n\n---\n\n# 7. “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate”\n\nCarl Jung went so deep into the mind that some say he lost his mind.\n\nIn 1931, at 38, Carl started to see visions and hear voices. He thought it might be schizophrenia or psychosis. He thought he lost touch with reality.\n\nBut this period of his life produced some of his greatest wisdom (like this quote above). He began to learn about the unconscious mind and its power. The unconscious mind doesn’t allow you to interrogate it.\n\nIt’s where auto-pilot behavior and thinking occurs.\n\nIn this quote, he tried to explain how our unconscious mind bizarrely directs our lives. And that if you let auto-pilot mode have too much power, you fall for the lies of fate and luck. This will ultimately lead you to become a powerless victim.\n\nWe now know that we can have power over our unconscious mind through:\n\n* Meditation\n* Visualization\n* Positive self-talk\n* Positive thinking\n* NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) that leads to neuroplasticity\n\nMeditation\n\nVisualization\n\nPositive self-talk\n\nPositive thinking\n\nNLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) that leads to neuroplasticity\n\n### How to apply it:\n\nMost of society is asleep.\n\nThey’re technically awake… but their phones transport them out of the physical world and into an unconscious digital world.\n\nTheir thoughts are automated, therefore, their trajectory in life is fixed. Don’t be one of these common people. Take back your life. Spend less time on your phone scrolling algorithmic feeds designed for robots. And…\n\nDare to meditate or study NLP.\n\nTell me which of the 7 quotes above you loved the most and why in the comments.\n\n---\n\nQuick note before we finish:\n\nI'm hosting a free masterclass next week called \"3 Social Media Post Templates Everyone Should Know.\"\n\nBeen in this online writing game for a decade.\n\nMy social media posts have earned me over 250 viral posts, 1B content views, and gave me the leverage for my current 7-figure business.\n\nI've learned a trick or two.\n\nNow it's time to share a trick or two.\n\nReserve your seat here.\n\n(Seats are limited)"
