Their big Lambo exhaust pipes, massive rubber wheels, gold chains, Rolex, and cheeky grins. There’s a photo of me somewhere on the internet bent over the front of a Lambo as if it’s mine.\n\nThe dream was to start an IT company. That’s what every dude did in the early 2000s to get rich. Or invent a phone app. Now in a world of AI we can generate these digital assets for a few dollars.\n\nI’ve learned what’s better than being a millionaire, though, is having F*ck You (F U) money. It’s a life-changing concept that’ll change how you work, live, and earn/spend money.\n\n# People want this more than money\n\nThe path to big cash seems smart.\n\nYou go from being a postcode povo to working your butt off and eventually making enough cash to live large in a mansion.\n\nExcept this isn’t the dream.\n\nI’ve achieved the goal of F U money and so have many of my closest friends. People don’t really want loads of money, even though at the start they genuinely feel they do.\n\nWhat they secretly want below the surface is free time.\n\nThis is a paradox though. The way to get more free time is to buy it with money. So unless you figure out how to make more money and increase your leverage, you’ll always be dreaming of little Cinderella fairies with $100 bills while sniffing the invisible coke of an unreachable dream.\n\nSo… how you think about money is crucial to unlocking F U money.\n\n# F U money is about having zero luxury possessions\n\nWait, what?\n\nYep. Buying luxury seems stupid when you have the ultimate prize of unlimited free time. I met a woman yesterday. She works at Apple. She lives in Melbourne near me but in a nicer postcode.\n\nShe was telling me how she bought this awesome BMW, and how they just went on a family trip in it. It was so comfortable and nice to drive, she said.\n\n> Me: “That BMW must have cost a lot.”\n\nMe: “That BMW must have cost a lot.”\n\n> Her: “Well, not really. It’s on a novated lease, so I pay $3000 a month for it.”\n\nHer: “Well, not really. It’s on a novated lease, so I pay $3000 a month for it.”\n\nShe then asked me what car I drive. I told her about my Honda Civic that turned 9 years old a few days ago. She didn’t get it.\n\n> “Why the heck would you drive that piece of crap when you don’t need to?”\n\n“Why the heck would you drive that piece of crap when you don’t need to?”\n\nShe didn’t understand F U money, which is fine. Not here to judge anyone. We don’t know what we don’t know. There’s no MBA in F U money (maybe I’ll create it).\n\nWe dug a little deeper. She told me how she used to have a great boss at Apple. Then they quit and now the new boss is an ass. He made her last two bonuses go to zero.\n\nShe still has her high salary, but in Australia she knows not too many other employers will pay her that much.\n\nAt 50 years old she’s terrified of layoffs or being fired by the new boss. Then we circle back to me. Why do I drive the Honda Civic? Because when I had the high salary I didn’t waste money on bullsh*t luxuries that took me further away from F U money.\n\nI was happy to drive the Civic and look poor so that now I can be wealthy and free. The trouble is once I got F U money, I couldn’t talk myself out of driving a crap car or living in an average house.\n\n* Needing luxury is a band-aid people buy when they’re not free.\n* Luxury is stupid to people who have F U money.\n\nNeeding luxury is a band-aid people buy when they’re not free.\n\nLuxury is stupid to people who have F U money.\n\nF U money is a mindset. It’s not just getting more money, it’s not needing so much money.\n\n“People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can't fathom” – Naval Ravikant\n\n# You no longer care about titles or status\n\nIn startup wank land people get h0rny over self-appointed titles they give themselves like founder or entrepreneur.\n\nIn corporate wank land it’s all about the “Head of Nothing” or “Chief Pleb Officer” titles. I used to froth over these.\n\nGetting an email from a Chief felt like losing my virginity. The feeling would wear off in seconds and I’d be right back to boredom and uncreative work. I later became a title titty, in love with sucking up to whoever the new, big job title was on the block.\n\nThings have changed.\n\nAccording to the title titties I’m currently a founder, CEO, or entrepreneur. But I don’t use any of these labels. My email signature is blank. I sign off with the word “Tim.” I have no real company logo. I just don’t f*cking care about titles anymore.\n\nYou could be The President Of The United States and I still don’t care.\n\nNobody tells me what to do, and I can leave my computer at any time and piss the day away eating banana sundaes if I want. Can ya do that at Amazon, bro? Nope. That’s what F U money does. It makes you immune to titles and status.\n\nHere’s the simple path to F U money:\n\n# 1. People need to know who the f*ck you are and what you stand for\n\nGhosts don’t get sh*t.\n\nA ghost is the typical human. They have a resume which is full of a bunch of nice stuff they say about themselves. They then bribe a bunch of people they barely know who they worked with to be references and back up the lies on their resume.\n\nIf you google them nothing comes up. They say stupid phrases like “trust me” when you ask about their capability.\n\nThey can tell you about a lot of stuff they’ve done, but what they don’t tell you is these achievements were divided unevenly across 50 different people. So trying to find out what they really did is impossible.\n\nThere’s a level above this. They’re the personal brand romantics. They are great at holding selfie poles in front of their big noses and reciting Mark Twain quotes until they get drunk from all the likes and go flog themselves off in a corner.\n\nThe path to F U money is simpler. You don’t need any of that.\n\nWhat you need is a riot act. A go-to-war mission statement that builds a movement. Some sort of online presence that isn’t all about you and your finger bang g-string line that launched last Friday at 3 AM for a limited time only.\n\nThe gurus will tell you to get 1M followers. I’d suggest you target 5000-10,000 followers and convert them into a newsletter faster than Usain Bolt.\n\nRemember: if I don’t know you and you have no social proof, then I don’t trust you and I sure as hell aren’t giving you an opportunity that helps you reach the milestone of F U money.\n\nTakeaway: build a small movement using social media.\n\n# 2. Upgrade from business virgin to at least this level\n\nFew weeks ago a person committed fraud against me.\n\nThey said they’ve worked in sales for 30 years working for this iconic Silicon Valley tech company. Part of the reason they got pissed off at me is they claimed I “upsold them” via email.\n\nAccording to his 30 years in sales, upselling is unethical. People only buy one product then never want anything ever again, even though he fan-girls over Microsoft Office which upsells people on the daily (because Microsoft Word can’t fix every problem a person encounters in their life/business).\n\nObviously I disagreed with him (side note: they were later found guilty of fraud).\n\nI call people like this business virgins.\n\nSomeone else’s logo did the selling for him. John, you were an order taker, mofo. There’s little to no skill involved when the sales and marketing are done for you. You’re just the whip cream on top of the sundae. People are buying whether you’re there or not. Wait until all that is gone. Then we’ll see what you’re made of, chief.\n\nWhen you become an owner your understanding of business and the financial markets is massively upgraded. You go from a 5th grader understanding of business and money to a billionaire on a yachts understanding of money.\n\nNot because you’re smarter, but because being an owner forces you to take off the adult-size nappy and sh*t yourself every day for a few years.\n\nIf you’re not an owner you’ll never have F U money.\n\nA job is modern slavery. Start there but don’t end there, amigo.\n\n# 3. Invest like the best (not what you think)\n\nF U money sounds like a sales pitch for “buy real estate” or “invest in the S&P 500 and you’ll be a rich b*tch at 95 when you can’t piss by yourself anymore.”\n\nBut the finance bros are wrong.\n\nThe best investment you can ever make is in yourself. What you don’t know is stopping you from the things that’ll make you enough money to permanently forget about money.\n\nIn the last 30 days I’ve spent $30,000+ on education – courses, masterminds, 1-1 coaching, group coaching, etc.\n\nI never used to do this. I was a tight-arse. But that’s why I couldn’t figure out the online game. I’m a 7-figure creator. If I want to become an 8-figure creator, I need to learn from and spend time with 8-figure creators.\n\nAn 8-figure creator isn’t gonna let me “pick their brain” over a raspberry milkshake because I’ve got gorgeous dimples and a 1/4 of a 6-pack. So I’ve learned to spend money to get around the people and ideas that’ll take me to the next level.\n\nA few weeks in a mastermind can make me more money than 40 years investing in the S&P 500 can. Ohh… and self-education for owners is usually tax deductible. As a result, I now have an unlimited self-education budget.\n\n(There’s one caveat with this approach which is it assumes you learn from people with social-proof who are practitioners. Obviously, if you invest in stupid sh*t sold by grifters and wannabes who teach people to make $50 per article on Medium dot com, well, you’re heading straight for the welfare line.)\n\nOnce your self-education is taken care of the next step is to reinvest in the business that is you. Maybe you’re a solopreneur or an entrepreneur with a few employees by this point. Nice one.\n\nInstead of taking money out of a business it’s better to reinvest in your business.\n\nBecause, once again, a business will make more money than copying Grandpa Warren Buffet’s investing strategy from last century.\n\nThe last stage of the funnel is investing in financial assets - stocks, gold, crypto, real estate, etc. This is the cherry on top and requires a basic financial education.\n\nThe point of financial assets, that most people don’t get, is they’re a way for you to store your wealth and protect against that wealth being stolen in the form of inflation. Said another way, financial assets store your time and prevent leaks.\n\nTakeaway: income is always #1 priority, storage of wealth is #2.\n\n# 4. Blow up your brain & go mildly insane\n\n* No more consumerism – discounts, specials, coupons.\n* No more politics/news – Fox, elections, CNN, Donald Duck.\n* No more losers – toxic people, complainers, blamers, people who always feel oppressed or worship the idea they’re a minority.\n* No more imposter syndrome – social proof wipes out the “I’m not an expert or “I’m not qualified.” These feelings are implanted deep in our brains from years ago, so we’ll justify paying $100K for a degree and maybe being silly enough to buy another one as a mature adult.\n\nNo more consumerism – discounts, specials, coupons.\n\nNo more politics/news – Fox, elections, CNN, Donald Duck.\n\nNo more losers – toxic people, complainers, blamers, people who always feel oppressed or worship the idea they’re a minority.\n\nNo more imposter syndrome – social proof wipes out the “I’m not an expert or “I’m not qualified.” These feelings are implanted deep in our brains from years ago, so we’ll justify paying $100K for a degree and maybe being silly enough to buy another one as a mature adult.\n\nBottom line: No more fear.\n\nYour brain helps navigate you towards F U money. If it’s messed up and distracted by all the stuff in the world you alone can't solve, it ain’t gonna help. Nothing is gonna happen. You’ll do what most people do and stand still screaming “I’m busy!”\n\nSociety needs us to feel busy so we’ll forget our freedom dream that leads to F U money. If you find yourself saying I’m busy, you’re already not free.\n\nThe solution is to prioritize freedom by pursuing this simple path to F U money. You now have the core steps. Go do it. Get free.\n\nTell me whether you agree with the idea of F U money and why in the comments.\n\n---\n\nI send this email weekly.
