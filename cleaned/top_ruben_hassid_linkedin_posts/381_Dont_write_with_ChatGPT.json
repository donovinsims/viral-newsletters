Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/gn48XKM8.\n\nHere's the prompt: \n\n\"Act like a senior conversion copywriter and editor.\n\nYour job is NOT to rewrite. Your job is to CRITIQUE.\n\nTask: Read my [sales page / email / landing page] and identify:\n1) The 3 weakest lines (and why they’re weak)\n2) Where the reader might lose interest\n3) What’s missing that would make this more persuasive\n\nBe brutally honest. No fluff. Grade each section A/B/C/D/F.\n\nHere’s my copy:\n///\n[paste your copy here]\n///\"\n\n---\n\nI couldn't upload the entire guide; it's too long.\n\nAccess it entirely here: https://lnkd.in/gn48XKM8.\n\nHelp your network",
