It is still a useful tool.\n✦ But you don't know where it's coming from.\n✦ I will teach how to replace it, for free.\n\nShortcut: read this → https://lnkd.in/dpAVAZSs.\n\n☑ Step 2. Find your favorite trusted source.\n\n✦ Health? Andrew Huberman.\n✦ Finance? Warren Buffett. \n✦ Sales? Alex Hormozi.\n\nGet their PDFs and YouTube video interview links.\n\n☑ Step 3. Go to NotebookLM.\n\n✦ Upload your sources (websites, PDF, YouTube).\n✦ Chat with your new agent (in the middle chatbot).\n✦ \"Save to note\" to keep it forever (on the right).\n✦ Use \"Audio overview\" to create a podcast.\n✦ Keep on building your agent with new sources.\n\nAfter watching this entire video (down below), you probably want to have access to my NotebookLM.\n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dueZmiBZ.\n\nIf you want to stay ahead, and master AI before it masters you, stop reading all of my Linkedin posts.\n\nInstead, subscribe to my newsletter how-to-ai.guide",
