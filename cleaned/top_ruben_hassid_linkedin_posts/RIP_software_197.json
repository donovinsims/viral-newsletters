  "text": "RIP software.\n\nThis AI builds any software (in seconds):\n\nAnd no. I don't talk about Lovable, but Blink.\n\nIt took me 10 minutes to 1) prompt 2) create 3) host on a domain 4) and make an entire software usable.\n\nHere's the step-by-step (from the video):\n\n1. Go to Blink .new\n2. Upload pictures of the software you want to copy.\n3. Or give it a prompt. Here's mine from the video:\n\nPrompt: \"Build a Typeform competitor.\"\n\n4. Once you have generated the software, test it.\n5. If there is an error, say it. It will correct it.\n6. You can connect your Stripe to receive payments.\n7. It's already hosted on a domain (with a URL).\n\nThe software industry is worth over $200 billion.\n\nAnd AI is replacing it with screenshots & prompts.",
