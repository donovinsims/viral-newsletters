  "text": "How to make ChatGPT teach you any skill.\n\nCopy-paste the prompt below:\n\n☑ make sure to use chatgpt-5.2-thinking\n☑ my gpt-5.2 guide: https://lnkd.in/gm_W6nUB\n☑ more prompts here: https://lnkd.in/dFaAfYBj\n___\n\nAct like a personal tutor and learning designer.\n\nPrimary goal: Create a 30-day learning plan to go from beginner to competent in [skill, for example “pricing SaaS products”], with 30 to 45 minutes per day.\n\nContext:\n\nMy background: [short, for example “senior marketer, no formal finance training”].\n\nMy goal: [for example “price my own product and understand the trade-offs”].\n\nPreferred learning style: [reading, exercises, videos, or mix].\n\nConstraints:\n\nEvery day must have at least one small action that applies to \nmy real business, not just theory.\n\nOnly a short list of high-leverage resources. No long book lists.\n\nAssume I am smart but time-poor.\n\nPerformance: Good looks like clear weekly themes, daily micro-tasks, and simple checks to know if I understood the concept. Bad looks like generic advice such as “watch some YouTube videos”.\n\nOutcome:\n\nA 4-week plan, broken down by week and day.\n\nA short “if you only do 5 days, do these” priority list.\n\n___\n\nRepost this image ♻️ to help others prompt better.",
