  "text": "You still copy & paste AI ideas into spreadsheets.\n\nBut you can brainstorm & create in a single app:\n\nNotion AI generates the entire board you see in my screenshot with one sentence. That’s their Build mode.\n\n☑ Type: “Create a database of content ideas for AI creators with columns: Content Type, AI Tools, Status, Difficulty.” Add more if needed.\n\n☑ Hit Build. Notion fills every row, tags each column, and even colour‑codes the status chips. 10 seconds.\n\n☑ Need tweaks? Ask again inside the same panel. It remembers context. No more content switching.\n\nWhy is this different?\n\n- AI Home puts the best models—GPT‑4.1 for depth or Claude 3.7 for speed—one click away at no extra cost.\n- 50 % of teams already claw back an hour a week using the new toolkit. That’s six extra workdays a year to ship more content.\n\nPro move: work a classified database to make Notion's search even faster / easier. I have over 3 years' worth of content in my Notion. It's now liquid gold.\n\nThat's why I partner with Notion & their AI team.\n\nI've reached a point where I can no longer switch. There is too much to lose to stop using Notion.\n\n#NotionPartner Try it here: https://ntn.so/RubenAIFW",
