  "text": "You use ChatGPT daily, but you never set it up. \n\nHere's how to do it (the right way):\n\n1. Custom Instructions \n→ This is context.\n\nYou’re telling ChatGPT who you are, what you care about, how you work, etc.\n\nExample fills:\n“I run a weekly newsletter about marketing & AI.”\n“My audience is founders and solo creators.”\n\nThe more you share, the more ChatGPT tailors answers to your workflow.\n\n2. Enable Memory \n→ This is where ChatGPT gets scary good.\n\nGo to:\n1. Settings.\n2. Personalization.\n3. Memory → Turn ON\n\nWhat happens next? ChatGPT remembers your name, your tone, your projects, your goals. \n\nNext time you say “Remember the article we wrote last week about [X]? I want the same style.\"\n\nBonus: You can see, edit, or delete anything it remembers. Total control.\n\nMaster AI with words (not code) → how-to-ai.guide",
