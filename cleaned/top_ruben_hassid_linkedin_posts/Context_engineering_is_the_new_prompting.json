  "text": "Context engineering is the new prompting.\n \n Save this framework to test it:\n\n→ Role: Define what the model should do.\n→ Objective: State the goal of the interaction.\n→ Context Package: Include all relevant context.\n→ Workflow: Outline the process to follow.\n→ Context Handling-Rules: Set rules.\n→ Output Format: Specify the answer format. \n→ First Action: Describe the model’s first step.\n\nLLMs perform best with rich context; the more you provide, the better their answers.\n\nIt's all about \"context engineering\" more than \"prompt engineering\". I wrote a free blog about it how to master it: https://lnkd.in/dDfJK_Mp.\n\nPS: I share how I master AI with words, not code, on my blog \"how-to-ai.guide\". Unsubscribe anytime.",
