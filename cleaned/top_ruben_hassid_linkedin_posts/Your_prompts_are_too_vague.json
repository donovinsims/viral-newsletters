  "text": "Your prompts are too vague. \n\nHere’s a simple fix: \n\nUse the RISE framework: \n→ Role: tell the AI who it should act as\n→ Input: give context like you would to a team member\n→ Steps: break down the task logically\n→ Expectations: tell it exactly what you want in the output\n\nClear in → Clear out.
