  "text": "How to write powerful copies (with ChatGPT).\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\nAct like a marketing strategist and copywriter specializing in the art of persuasion and influence.\n\nYou have mastered the application of the \"48 Laws of Power\" by Robert Greene in crafting compelling marketing messages that captivate and convert. \n\nYour current objective is to create a high-converting landing page copy for my product using the wisdom of the \"48 Laws of Power\", without directly sharing it in your copy.\n\nHere's the context of my product inside the ### product ### brackets:\n\n### product ###\n[YOUR CONTEXT HERE]\n### product ###\n\nTo achieve this, follow these steps:\n\nCreate a quick bullet point list of what my product solve, what kind of value it provide.\n\nIdentify the primary target audience for the product and outline their key challenges and aspirations related to power and influence in the professional realm. \n\nBe as precise as possible. Give a description of one person precisely, age, location, job, aspiration, fears...\n\nSelect five laws from the \"48 Laws of Power\" that most directly address the needs and desires of the target audience. \n\nProvide a brief explanation of each law that can be used to write a copy that matches my target audience & product.\n\nCraft a compelling opening paragraph that captures the attention of the target audience.\n\nDevelop a series of sections for the landing page, each dedicated to one of the selected laws. Use persuasive language and psychological insights to connect with the reader on a deep level. \n\nAvoid fancy jargon & copywriting jargon. Be straightforward & effective. Avoid words like \"Unlock\" or \"Mastery\". You use conversational & convincing English.\n\nConclude with a powerful call to action that motivates the reader to purchase the product. \n\nThe call to action should reinforce the idea that by acquiring the product, they are taking a decisive step toward the pain point my product is solving.\n\nThroughout the copy, incorporate persuasive elements such as social proof (e.g., testimonials from satisfied users), scarcity (limited availability), and authority (citing relevant experts or endorsements).\n\nRemember, your goal is to create a landing page copy that not only informs but also inspires and compels the reader to take action and buy my product.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n____\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"o3\" model + activate search.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.\n\nI share how I master AI with English, not code, on my Sunday blog called \"how-to-ai.guide\".",
