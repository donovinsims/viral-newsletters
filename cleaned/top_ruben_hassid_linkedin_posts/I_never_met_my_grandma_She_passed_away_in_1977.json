  "text": "I never met my grandma. She passed away in 1977.\n\nBut AI helped me see her moving:\n\n✦ I uploaded a black & white picture from 1963.\n✦ I asked Gemini first to naturally restore it.\n✦ I then asked Gemini (again) to animate it.\n\nFor the full guide (with prompts to copy & paste, and the necessary links to the tools), go to this website: https://lnkd.in/dtePiWa4.\n\nIt's a completely free AI guide I wrote this morning.\n\nTo access all of my archives, go to https://lnkd.in/dDhmdQPj or https://lnkd.in/dSj2SU9Z (it has more guides).",
