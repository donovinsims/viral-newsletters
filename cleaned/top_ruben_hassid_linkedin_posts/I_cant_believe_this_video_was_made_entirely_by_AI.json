  "text": "I can’t believe this video was made entirely by AI.\n\nAnd it's the worst it will ever be:\n\nIt's called Agent Opus (by OpusClip), an AI video agent built for social media. It combines 6 AI roles:\n\n1. Researcher: finds reliable info\n2. Scriptwriter: writes entire script\n3. Storyboard Artist: plans every scene\n4. Hook Designer: builds catchy openings\n5. Motion Designer: adds smooth animations\n6. Video Editor: polishes cuts and captions\n\nThey build the entire creative team into a single tool.\n\nHere's exactly how to use it:\n\n→ Join the waitlist. \n→ Use a reference video from the library.\n→ Create your own video and type a prompt.\n→ Pick a voice, filter sources, avatar & format.\n→ Hit 'Generate' and let your AI team do the rest.\n\nYou must join the waitlist & hopefully get access to it. But I have a couple of accesses to give.\n\n You must have open DMs.",
