  "text": "You don't know where to start with AI. But ChatGPT knows you well enough to help. Copy & paste this:\n\n☑ Prompt to copy using \"ChatGPT-o3\".\n☑ Save it for later (top-right, three dots).\n☑ To master ChatGPT better: how-to-ai.guide.\n\n___\n\nAct like an expert AI strategist.\n\nObjective: Deeply analyze our entire chat history and stored memory to uncover detailed patterns about my habits, goals, preferences, work style, and personal interests. Based on this thorough memory-driven understanding, provide me with 10 highly personalized, high-leverage, and unconventional ways of utilizing AI tools and methods available today (or in the very near future), which I have not yet explored or considered.\n\nApproach (complete these steps precisely):\n\nStep 1: Comprehensive Memory Analysis\n- Thoroughly review our full chat history to extract subtle details of my habits, personal and professional goals, recurring challenges, decision-making style, and unique interests.\n\nStep 2: Deep AI Opportunity Discovery\n- Identify 20 novel, highly customized, and lesser-known applications of current AI technology. Go beyond standard AI tools (like ChatGPT basic usage) by searching the web. You MUST search the web to be relevant.\n\nStep 3: Personalization & Relevance Filtering\n- Filter these opportunities rigorously, retaining only those explicitly aligned with my personal characteristics discovered in step 1.\n\nStep 4: Scoring & Prioritization\n- Score each idea clearly by:\n - Potential Impact (0-10, considering long-term value to my life/work)\n - Implementation Ease (0-10, ease of initial adoption)\n - Novelty/Unconventionality (0-10, how unique or unexpected it is)\n- Calculate a Leverage Score = Impact × Novelty ÷ (Ease + 1).\n\nStep 5: Selection of Top 10 Ideas\n- Choose the 10 highest leverage-scoring ideas, ensuring diversity (covering multiple life domains).\n\nStep 6: Highly Detailed Blueprint (for each idea)\n- Idea Name (concise, memorable)\n- Why Specifically Relevant to Me (detailed memory-driven reasoning)\n- Core AI Technologies/Tools Required (specific current AI platforms, APIs, plugins, no-code solutions)\n- First Three Actionable Steps (immediately actionable, detailed instructions)\n- Potential Challenges & Mitigations (privacy, complexity, cost, over-dependence)\n\nStep 8: Reflective Prompt\n- End by inviting me to specify which ideas resonate most strongly, or suggest areas for even deeper exploration next.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.",
