  "text": "You don't need Universal Basic Income.\n\nYou need Universal Basic Intelligence:\n\n☑ UAE is the first country to give free ChatGPT. \n☑ The $20 plan is free for the entire population.\n☑ It gives fair, unlimited access to intelligence.\n\nAnd I think that's the right way of seeing the future.\n\nUniversal income can lead to poverty trap:\n→ It stacks poorly with taxes (e.g., high effective marginal tax rates).\n→ It prevents skill development or ambition if people get stuck in subsistence mode.\n\nPeople don't want AI to do all of the work.\n↳ People want AI to help do better work, faster.\n\nSo giving access to a \"Universal Basic Intelligence\" might be the best way to help humanity.\n\n✕ I don't want free money to do nothing.\n☑ I want to have more tools to do better.\n\nIf you agree with me,",
