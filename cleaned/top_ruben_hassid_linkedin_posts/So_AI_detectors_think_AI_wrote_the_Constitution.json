  "text": "So AI detectors think AI wrote the Constitution.\n\nAnd you still think you can detect AI??\n\n✦ Sure, you see em dashes–everyone does.\n✦ Sure, you hate to read the AI expressions like:\n\n1. \"It's not [X]. It's [Y]\" \n\n↳ \"Credit card fraud isn't just evolving—it's accelerating!\"\n↳ \"The teams who will thrive now aren’t just using AI for speed. They’re combining it with judgment, experience and original thinking.\"\n\n2. “From X to Y”\n\n↳ \"From ancient traditions to modern innovations..”\n↳ \"From the depth of Linkedin to the realm of...\"\n\n3. I listed them all here: https://lnkd.in/dTUF4j-U.\n\n✦ But AI detectors are still a scam.\n\nAndrej Karpathy, one of the creators of ChatGPT, also agrees. You can't detect AI text correctly.\n\nAI detectors are just pattern-matching machines. They learned what “AI text” looks like. And what “human text” looks like.\n\nBut here’s the problem.\n\nHumans can write robotic text. AI can write natural text. The two overlap. A lot.\n\nSo I wrote an entire guide to master:\n\n1. The truth about AI detection bots.\n2. How to forever avoid sounding like an AI.\n3. The copy & paste prompt to edit any text and remove its AI feel.\n\nAccess the guide here: https://lnkd.in/dTUF4j-U.",
