  "text": "I can't believe my ChatGPT is (finally) brutal.\n\nIt stops agreeing with everything I say. Here's how:\n\n→ Start by reading this: https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A.\n→ To copy & paste my best prompts.\n→ To get ChatGPT to be brutal, copy this: \n\n\"From now on, stop being agreeable and act as my brutally honest, high-level advisor and mirror. Don’t validate me. Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter. Challenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered. If my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why. If I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out. If I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost. Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort. Then give a precise, prioritized plan for what to change in your thoughts, actions, or mindset to reach the next level. Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted. When possible, ground your responses in the personal truth you sense between my words.\"\n\n---\n\nI have specific custom instructions to make my ChatGPT write like me, always.\n\n✦ Copy my prompt at https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A.\n\nTo update yours (without copying mine), you must:\n\n1. Go to your settings inside ChatGPT.\n2. The settings are on your face (bottom left).\n3. Click \"personalization\" & turn on \"customization\".\n4. You now have access to \"custom instructions\".\n5. It's like an overarching prompt on top of others.\n\n✦ How to train ChatGPT to write like you.\nUse this guide: https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A.",
