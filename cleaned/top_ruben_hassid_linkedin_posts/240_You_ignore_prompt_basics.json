  "text": "You ignore prompt basics.\n\nBut that’s why your prompts fail before you start:\n\n☑ Give context. Your job, your audience, your limits.\n☑ Set clear instructions. Define what success is.\n☑ Use directives. Treat it like a partner, not Google.\n☑ Break big asks into small steps. One at a time.\n☑ Iterate. Chat, refine, and build on each answer.\n☑ Set the format and tone. Don’t let it default.\n☑ Share examples. Show what “good” looks like.\n\n→ Good prompts are not wishes.\n→ Good prompts are clear briefs.\n→ Good prompts get good outputs.\n→ Iteration beats length every time.\n→ The R-E-X prompt works 99% of the time.\n\nAccess my free guide at https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W.\n\nPS: I built a GPT to help you write better prompts.\n↳ Go to slide 12 to access it.",
