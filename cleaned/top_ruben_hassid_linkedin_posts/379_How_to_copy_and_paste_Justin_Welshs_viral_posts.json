  "text": "How to copy (and paste) Justin Welsh's viral posts.\n\nA complete step-by-step with AI:\n\n1. Check the new app.easygen.io (7-day free trial).\n2. Go to \"Trending\" and select \"Justin Welsh\".\n3. Rank by \"Outlier index\" (=most viral posts).\n4. Select one you enjoy. Click \"Repurpose\".\n5. Write a new topic of your own.\n\nTo make it your own, you must:\n\n☑ Write the best topic possible to repurpose.\n☑ Be on-trend. What do people care about?\n☑ Make it contrarian, with a bold take.\n\nPS: I love Justin's content. Especially his Saturday newsletter. This post is simply a gimmick for you to try.\n\nThe actual value is in repurposing YOURSELF.\n\n1. Get to know your best posts (check outlier index).\n2. Click on \"Repurpose\" inside app.easygen.io.\n3. Twist the post. Change the topic. \n\nPro move: Make us feel different, a new perspective.\n\n\"But Ruben, AI content does not work on Linkedin!\"\n\nWell, you're wrong. You simply don't know how.\n\nI grew 5x accounts with AI:\n↳ Mine to 630,000 followers.\n↳ Axelle Malek to 80,000 followers.\n↳ Anisha Jain to 70,000 followers, too.\n↳ How to AI & How to Prompt to 100,000+.\n\nAI works with taste. EasyGen is only the tool. \n☑ You're the one building the community. \n☑ You're the one creating the content.",
