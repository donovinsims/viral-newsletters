  "text": "How Gemini made my new Linkedin profile picture:\n\n1. Upload a simple photo of you.\n2. Upload a reference profile picture you love.\n3. Copy & paste the following prompt:\n4. I wrote a guide to gain 10,000 Linkedin followers.\n5. Go here to access it: https://lnkd.in/eifHDEGu\n\nPrompt: “Generate a corporate headshot of my image in [how you are dressed] in the same style as the 2nd image I uploaded as an inspiration”.\n\n6. If you don’t have any inspiration, copy this prompt (with your upload): https://lnkd.in/eifHDEGu\n\nI don't need an expensive photographer.\n\nAnd this is a shock to me too (me, the AI guy).\n\nIf you know someone who needs a new LinkedIn photo, send it to them or save this guide for later.\n\nFollow Ruben never to miss my daily post.",
