  "text": "The “Big Bang” of AI is happening.\n\nHere’s what the 2025 data shows:\n\n1. The top 10 AI chatbots now own the web.\n\nFrom August 2024 to July 2025, the top 10 AI chatbots captured 58.8% of all web traffic. \n\nThe internet is becoming one with AI.\n\n2. ChatGPT is the clear leader.\n\nChatGPT alone took 48.36% of the entire market.\n\n☑ 46.59 billion annual web visits\n☑ 2.4 million annual media citations\n☑ 106% year-over-year growth\n\nNo other chatbot comes close. \nChatGPT is the new front door to the internet.\n\n3. The competition is heating up.\n\nGrok, Gemini, and Claude are rising fast.\n\nEach has its unique strengths:\n\n↳ Grok: rapid user growth.\n↳ Claude: best at coding/writing.\n↳ Gemini: cheap & strong coding.\n\nBut none have matched ChatGPT’s reach or influence (yet).\n\n4. The numbers are hard to believe.\n\n✦ 55.88 billion total chatbot visits in 12 months.\n✦ 123.35% year-over-year traffic growth.\n✦ 7.7 million media citations.\n\nAI chatbots are the new infrastructure of the web\n\n5. This is bigger than the Internet revolution.\n\nAI chatbots are not just another tech wave.\n\nThey are more like electricity: an invisible force that will power everything.\n\nAt first, electricity seemed like a lightbulb. Then it became the backbone of modern life (and eventually, the internet & AI).\n\nChatbots are following the same path. \n\nIt’s hard to predict what comes next, but the scale is clear.\n\nPS: I am Ruben, and I write about 'How to AI' with English, not code.
