  "text": "32 ChatGPT shortcut hacks for faster prompts:\n\n(worth saving for later)\n\nAdd one of these at the very start of your prompt.\nExample: ELI5: [your topic] → get a simple, kid-friendly explanation.\n\n——\n\n/ELI5 is used to explain as if to a 5-year-old.\n/TLDL summarizes a very long text in a few lines.\n/STEP-BY-STEP lays out reasoning step by step.\n/CHECKLIST turns a response into a checklist.\n/EXEC SUMMARY gives a quick executive-style summary.\n/ACT AS makes ChatGPT speak in a specific role.\n/BRIEFLY forces a very short answer.\n/JARGON asks to use technical vocabulary.\n/AUDIENCE adapts the response to a chosen audience.\n/TONE changes the tone (formal, funny, dramatic, etc.).\n/DEV MODE simulates a raw, technical developer style.\n/PM MODE gives a project-management perspective.\n/SWOT produces a strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats analysis.\n/FORMAT AS enforces a specific format (table, JSON, etc.).\n/COMPARE puts two or more things side by side.\n/MULTI-PERSPECTIVE shows several points of view.\n/CONTEXT STACK keeps multiple layers of context in memory.\n/BEGIN WITH / END WITH forces starting or ending with something.\n/ROLE: TASK: FORMAT: explicitly defines the role, the task, and the expected format.\n/SCHEMA generates a structured outline or a data model.\n/REWRITE AS: rephrases in a requested style.\n/REFLECTIVE MODE prompts the AI to reflect on its own answer.\n/SYSTEMATIC BIAS CHECK asks to identify biases.\n/DELIBERATE THINKING forces slower, more thoughtful reasoning.\n/NO AUTOPILOT forbids superficial, autopilot responses.\n/EVAL-SELF asks for a critical self-evaluation of the response.\n/PARALLEL LENSES examines from several angles in parallel.\n/FIRST PRINCIPLES rebuilds from fundamental basics.\n/CHAIN OF THOUGHT shows intermediate reasoning.\n/PITFALLS identifies possible traps and errors.\n/METRICS MODE expresses answers with measures and indicators.\n/GUARDRAIL sets strict boundaries not to cross.\n\n——\n\nSubscribe for free at my newsletter on \"how to AI\" with English, not code → how-to-prompt.ai.",
