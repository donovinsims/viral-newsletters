  "text": "The new em-dash to recognize ChatGPT instantly:\n\n1. \"That's not [X]. That's [Y].\"\n2. \"In a world where [scary change], [virtue] becomes [advantage].\"\n3. \"Most people [lazy thing]. The few who win [disciplined thing].\"\n4. \"Here's the truth: [obvious statement].\"\n5. \"If you're not doing [X], you're already behind.\"\n\nI shared more here: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.\n\nThese patterns are everywhere.\n\nLinkedIn. Emails. Cold outreach. Even serious business proposals. The em-dash was the first tell. Now it's these patterns.\n\nThey sound smart. But they say nothing specific.\n\nHere's how to fix your AI writing:\n\n1.Kill the meta commentary. \"Let's walk through...\" \"In this section, we will explore...\" Delete all of it. Just say the thing.\n\n2. Vary your sentence length. AI writes like a metronome. Every sentence is medium. Break the rhythm. Short hits hard. Then give room to breathe with a longer one.\n\n3. Take a stance. Not \"This may potentially offer benefits.\" But \"This works for small teams. Big companies will struggle with it.\"\n\n4. Use \"I\" and \"you.\" AI defaults to passive voice. You're writing for people. Talk to them.\nCut the padding. \"Highlighting the importance of...\" adds zero information. Delete it.\n\n5. Read this anti-AI guide: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.",
