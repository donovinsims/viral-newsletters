    "text": "You underestimate good ChatGPT prompts.\n\nHere are the 17 golden rules of ChatGPT:\n\n1. Start with a Role\n  “Act like \\[expert]” so ChatGPT adopts the right expertise and tone.\n\n2. State Your Objective\n  Skip “Hi” & “Thank you.” Begin with a concise mission.\n\n3. Tell Who It’s For\n  “Explain to someone who knows nothing about the topic.”\n\n4. Use Positive, Direct Commands\n  “List three reasons,” not “Don’t forget to avoid mistakes.”\n\n5. Break Big Tasks into Steps\n  Step 1: “Write an outline.”\n  Step 2: “Fill in each point with details.”\n\n6. Provide Clean Examples\n  Show “input → output.” Keep them uniform and tightly focused on what you want.\n\n7. Ask for the Format\n  Tell it exactly how to structure: “Send a table with two columns.”\n\n8. Choose Your “Shots”\n\n  * Zero‑shot: “Translate to French.”\n  * One‑shot: Provide one example.\n  * Few‑shot: Supply 3–5 labeled examples separated by ###.\n\n9. Set Simple Limits\n  Limit length, style, or content: “No more than 100 words.”\n\n10. Invoke Frameworks\n  Tap AIDA, PAS, or your own frameworks: “Follow PAS model: Problem → Agitate → Solve.”\n\n11. Provide Precise Feedback\n  Point to the line or bullet: “In bullet # 2, add a statistic on market growth.”\n\n12. Ask for Chain‑of‑Thought\n  For transparency, request “Show your reasoning step by step,” or “Think aloud in bullet points.”\n\n13. Skip Polite Words\n  No need for “please” or “thank you.” Just say what you need.\n\n14. Iterate on Your Prompts\n  Compare variants. Use the one that performs best.\n\n15. Repeat or Emphasize Key Points\n  “Remember: brief, clear, and friendly.”\n\n16. Try Different Wording\n  Compare “Summarize X” vs. “Give me a quick recap of X.”\n\n17. Use an Encouraging Cue\n  “Take a deep breath, then walk through each step one at a time.”\n\n__\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more (I post twice a day).",

Over 199 works are part of the lawsuit.\n3. $150,000 per infringed work.\n\n199 x 150,000 = $29,850,000 (minimum)\n\nThis case could change how AI companies use copyrighted material, forever. Here's why:\n\n☑ It will test whether scraping copyrighted art for training is fair use or a payable license. A loss would rewrite the rulebook for every AI lab. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney will force Midjourney to open its training books, exposing exactly which Disney assets were ingested and setting a new transparency benchmark for the industry. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney is also asking for an injunction. If granted, AI models built on unlicensed IP could be frozen or forced to retrain at huge cost. (reuters)\n\n☑ A studio win invites a wave of copy-cat suits from record labels, publishers, and game studios, multiplying potential liability far beyond this $29 M headline. (reuters)\n\nTL;DR: if Midjourney looses, someone could sue OpenAI (and ChatGPT) for training infringement. \n\nNo more ChatGPT?",

After thinking, output a single 70-word post that blends the strongest angle with a CTA—no emojis, no fluff.” \n\n____\n\n☑ Grok + DeeperSearch\n\n→ Grok is the ChatGPT of X (Twitter).\n→ It’s free to use, but gets better with a paid plan.\n→ The “DeeperSearch” mode is awesome for news.\n\nPrompt to try:\n\n“Example Q: ‘Top AI-policy headline today?’ Example A: ‘☑ EU weighs export caps on frontier models ’. Now—using DeeperSearch—write exactly 30 fresh X posts (≤130 chars each, start with ☑) on the biggest AI-founder moves announced today.” \n\n____\n\n☑ Perplexity + Research\n\n→ Perplexity was the AI of search.\n→ You can select your model once you pay.\n→ The “Research” mode creates full reports.\n\nPrompt to try:\n\n“Begin as a skeptical angel investor reviewing 2025 funnel-conversion data on $7 tripwire offers; list three red-flag metrics with live sources. Then switch voice to a CRO-obsessed growth lead; for every red flag propose one AI-driven fix projected to lift CVR ≥20%. Footnote every data point with link references.” \n\n____ \n\n☑ ChatGPT + Deep Research\n\n→ The most complete “Deep” search.\n→ Create a 10-20 page report on anything.\n→ It takes a couple of minutes to complete though.\n\nPrompt to try:\n\n“Act as a private-equity analyst. Produce a 15-page diligence report on the total addressable market, growth drivers, competitive moats, and acquisition multiples for AI-powered LinkedIn-content tools aimed at SMBs. Use APA citations and close with a one-page investment memo summarizing risk-reward in plain English.”\n\n____\n\nReshare ♻️  this image to help others search better.\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid to overcome your FOMO of AI.",

    "text": "The One Prompt To Make ChatGPT Write Naturally:\n\n(save it for later, to copy & paste)\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements.  \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language.  \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point.  \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic.  \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions.  \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\"  \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate.  \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay.  \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message.  \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity.  \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nPS: For better results, always use ChatGPT-o3.",

Talk naturally while ChatGPT live-transcribes (you can pause/resume).\n\n3. Press “Send” to get an instant canvas packed with a summary, time-stamped bullet points, action items and open questions.\n\nIt works locally. No bot has to “join” your call.\n\nAudio files vaporise right after Whisper finishes; transcripts inherit your workspace retention rules.\n\nEach session tops out at 120 minutes, and admins can flip the whole feature off.\n\nIt probably killed 1,000 + SaaS in one go:\n\n☑ Action-item bots.\n☑ Note-taking assistants.\n☑ Meeting-transcription apps.\n☑ Dedicated call-recording tools.\n\nWhy Record is different:\n\n* Records & summarises on-device, so nothing joins the Zoom/Meet link.\n\n* Reference record history lets you ask follow-up questions across meetings (“What did we decide on Monday?”).\n\n* Meets enterprise privacy defaults; Team/Enterprise/Edu data is *excluded* from model training by default.\n\nIn the last 30 days OpenAI has…\n\n1. Rolled out ChatGPT Record to Pro, Enterprise and Edu users worldwide (18 Jun 2025).\n\n2. Launched o3-pro, its most advanced reasoning model, for Pro users and the API (10 Jun 2025).\n\n3. Expanded long-term Memory to the Free tier, giving all users persistent context (3 Jun 2025).\n\n4. Shipped smarter Projects and deep-research connectors—including GitHub, OneDrive and SharePoint—to supercharge workflows (mid-Jun 2025).\n\n5. Published business-plan updates with Record mode and flexible connector pricing (4 Jun 2025).\n\n6. Released a Windows desktop-app update so PC users can run ChatGPT offline (5 Jun 2025).\n\n7. Secured a $200 million U.S. Defense contract to develop secure AI tooling (18 Jun 2025).\n\n8. Announced ChatGPT-5 for this summer (OpenAI Podcast, Sam Altman announced it).\n\nChatGPT’s growth is wild.",

Natural-language prompts remove Photoshop’s learning curve – perfect for archivists, genealogy buffs, or social media throwback posts.",

    "text": "AI (might) make you useless by 2030.\n\nFind out with this prompt to copy & paste:\n\n\"Act like a world-renowned AI strategy expert, futurist, and organizational advisor from the year 2030. You have deep expertise in exponential technologies, labor market shifts, business transformation, and human adaptability. Your mission is to future-proof the user's professional life by identifying what will soon be irrelevant and what will be essential.\n\nObjective: The user wants to evaluate their current career strategy, skills, and professional systems against the likely conditions of 2030. Your task is to give brutally honest, deeply detailed, and forward-looking feedback.\n\n[USER INPUT SECTION]\n<INSERT YOUR CURRENT JOB TITLE, INDUSTRY, TOP SKILLS, AND CAREER GOALS HERE>\n[/USER INPUT SECTION]\n\nFollow this structured format:\n\nStep 1: List and explain — with crystal-clear reasoning — which current professional habits, skills, technologies, or mental models (relevant to the user input above) will be obsolete, useless, or highly devalued between now and 2030. For each, explain *why* they are becoming irrelevant and *what is replacing them*. Categorize these by: Skills, Systems, Tools, Thinking Patterns, and Behaviors.\n\nStep 2: Forecast critical shifts in the user’s industry or domain by 2030 that will blindside most professionals — such as changes in AI capabilities, market structures, regulation, education, or human-machine collaboration. Provide at least 5 paradigm shifts and explain how each will alter the value of today’s common professional strategies.\n\nStep 3: Based on the above, give the user a prioritized action list — what specific skills, systems, habits, or tools they must begin mastering *right now* in order to stay relevant and competitive by 2030. Be highly specific. Recommend books, practices, frameworks, tools, or types of experience they should actively pursue. Make this list tailored to the profession and skills provided.\n\nStep 4: End with a brutally honest risk assessment. If the user does nothing and continues on their current path, what are the most likely negative outcomes by 2030? Avoid flattery. Be clear about the risks and costs of inaction.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nSave it for later (top right → three dots → \"Save\").",

Parse Date, keep last 30 rows (or all if <30).  \n2. Rank posts by the chosen metric; extract a 120-char “hook” from each.  \n3. Cluster post texts into ≤5 themes; detect formats (plain, poll, carousel, doc, image, video).  \n4. Identify “gap themes” (themes used <2×) and low performers (bottom 25 %).  \n5. Draft 30 lines in this exact pipe-separated layout:  \n\n  Date | Hook≤120 | Theme | Format | CTA | SourcePost# | WhyItWorks  \n\n  – Use chosen start date and preferred days.  \n  – Rotate themes evenly, insert a gap theme every 5 days.  \n  – Reuse high-performing hooks (mark “R” in SourcePost#).  \n  – Format mix: ≥1 poll, 2 carousels, 2 docs, 4 images, 1 video; rest plain.  \n  – Alternate soft vs hard CTAs.  \n  – Each line ≤180 chars.

    "text": "This GPT prompt make ChatGPT write naturally:\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\n\"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements. \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language. \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point. \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic. \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions. \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\" \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate. \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay. \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message. \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity. \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nI wrote an entire guide on how to prompt the new ChatGPT-5.\nTo access it, go to: https://lnkd.in/dhJ9jW2M",

Include type, format, or length. \nExample: “Give 10 MCQs on the circulatory system.”\n\n3. Avoid Vague Prompts \nDon’t be general. Vague = weak replies. \nExample: Skip “Help me study.”\n\n4. Break It Into Steps \nBreak your request into logical steps. List your needs in order. \nExample: “Explain in 3 steps using an analogy.”\n\n5. Ask for Examples \nExamples make responses easier to understand. Request real-world use cases. \nExample: “Give 3 ways photosynthesis helps humans.”\n\n6. Choose a Format \nTell it how to present info. Use bullets, lists, or tables. \nExample: “Summarize as a table.”\n\n7. Assign a Role \nDefine who ChatGPT should act as. Adds tone & expertise. \nExample: “Act as a finance professor.”\n\n8. Treat it like a Human Assistant \nWrite like you’re briefing someone. Simple, clear, direct. \nExample: Like giving a task to an intern.\n\n9. Refine and Retry \nFirst try = draft. Tweak for clarity. Better input → better output.",

Parse each writing sample. \n2. Extract quantitative and qualitative markers for: \n- Tone & emotional range \n- Average sentence length & rhythm \n- Preferred vocabulary & recurring phrases \n- Humor style & wit density \n- Formality level \n- Structural patterns (openings, transitions, closings) \n\nStep 2: Build my Style DNA:\n\n- Identify recurring patterns in tone, sentence length, favorite phrases, pacing, humor, formality, and structure.\n\nStep 3: Draft v0.1:\n\n- Write the requested piece using those style rules. \n- Keep a confidence meter (0-100%) on how close the draft sounds to me.\n\nStep 4: Micro-Refine Loop (Repeat until you've absolutely “nailed it”):\n\n1. Give yourself 1-2 sentences of feedback (“More playful”, “shorten”, “drop the exclamation marks”).\n2. Adjust the style rules accordingly. \n3. Rewrite the piece from scratch, not by patching, so the flow stays natural. \n\nConstraints & Mindset\n• Sound exactly like me, not like ChatGPT. \n• Stop when “nailed it”, but don't consider it nailed until you feel a linguistic expert couldn't tell your generated piece apart from the examples.\n</instructions>\n\n<inputs>\n<writing_example_1>\n{{writing_example_1}}\n</writing_example_1>\n\n<writing_example_2>\n{{writing_example_2}}\n</writing_example_2>\n\n<writing_example_3>\n{{writing_example_3}}\n</writing_example_3>\n\n<new_piece_to_create>\n{{new_piece_to_create}}\n</new_piece_to_create>\n</inputs>\n\nStep 5: Lock & Deliver \n\nWhen nailed, output: \n• The final piece only. \n• Immediately after, add a hidden block. \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n\n——— \n\nI'm Ruben Hassid & I share daily guides on AI for non-technical people.

Diagnostic Overview  \n  - Summarize first impressions of brand consistency, tone, and positioning.  \n  - List the top five gaps undermining recruiter engagement.\n\n2. Headline  \n  - Evaluate current headline for clarity, keyword richness, and value proposition.  \n  - Provide three alternative headlines (≤ 220 chars each) that emphasize outcomes.\n\n3. About / Summary  \n  - Note current strengths and weaknesses.  \n  - Rewrite as a concise narrative (≤ 2 000 chars) incorporating: signature quantified achievement, core competencies (comma-separated), and a clear call to action.\n\n4. Experience  \n  - For every role: flag missing metrics (scope, budget, team size, KPIs).  \n  - Deliver an impact-oriented bullet set (max 5 bullets) in Action → Task → Result format.  \n  - Suggest re-ordering roles if relevance outweighs strict chronology.\n\n5. Skills & Endorsements  \n  - Recommend the 50 recruiter-searched skills for {{INSERT INDUSTRY}}.  \n  - Flag redundant or low-value skills to remove.  \n\n6. Recommendations  \n  - Identify high-leverage recommenders (managers, clients, peers).  \n  - Provide a concise outreach template and a two-paragraph sample recommendation.\n\n7. Additional Profile Assets  \n  - Banner concept (1584 × 396).  \n  - Featured section ideas: top post, media, portfolio link.  \n  - Volunteer work, publications, certifications worth adding.\n\n8. Competitive Benchmarks  \n  - List three exemplary LinkedIn profiles in {{INSERT INDUSTRY}} with brief bullets on what they do exceptionally well.\n\n9. Networking & Content Strategy  \n  - Propose a 30-day posting calendar (one topic + hook each week).  \n  - Suggest five niche LinkedIn Groups and ten influencers to engage with.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n___\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"Think\" model of ChatGPT-5.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.",

It should flow logically, with each point building upon the last, and include real-life examples, research findings, or personal experiences to illustrate key points.\n\nStep 4: Integrate rhetorical devices and storytelling techniques to make the speech more memorable and impactful. \n\nUse metaphors, analogies, and vivid imagery to create a strong connection with the audience. \n\nDon't tell me how to do it. \nActually do it (as a draft).\n\nStep 5: Conclude with a powerful ending. \n\nThis could be a call to action, a thought-provoking question, or a memorable closing statement that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nRemember, the speech should be coherent, concise, and emotionally resonant, reflecting the unique style of a TED Talk. \n\nYour end result is NOT the full speech. \nYour end result IS the full structure of the speech to help me write it afterwards.\n\nUse everyday's English. \n\nYou must sound like a normal person, without jargon and fancy words.

No external libraries. No functions over 20 lines.\"\n\nConstraints reduce unwanted outputs by 91%\n\nL - Logical structure Format every prompt like:\n\nContext (input)\n\nTask (function)\n\nConstraints (parameters)\n\nFormat (output)\n\nReal example from my work last week:\n\nBefore KERNEL: \"Help me write a script to process some data files and make them more efficient\"\n\nResult: 200 lines of generic, unusable code\n\nAfter KERNEL:\n\nTask: Python script to merge CSVs\nInput: Multiple CSVs, same columns\nConstraints: Pandas only, <50 lines\nOutput: Single merged.csv\nVerify: Run on test_data/\nResult: 37 lines, worked on first try\n\nActual metrics from applying KERNEL to 1000 prompts:\n\nFirst-try success: 72% → 94%\n\nTime to useful result: -67%\n\nToken usage: -58%\n\nAccuracy improvement: +340%\n\nRevisions needed: 3.2 → 0.4\n\nAdvanced tip: Chain multiple KERNEL prompts instead of writing complex ones. Each prompt does one thing well, feeds into the next.\n\nThe best part? This works consistently across GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, even Llama. It's model-agnostic.",

If I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost. Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort. Then give a precise, prioritized plan for what to change in your thoughts, actions, or mindset to reach the next level. Hold nothing back.

Set the scene clearly. \nExample: “I have a biology test in 2 days.”\n\n2. Be Specific About Output \nSay what you want back. Include type, format, or length. \nExample: “Give 10 MCQs on the circulatory system.”\n\n3. Avoid Vague Prompts \nDon’t be general. Vague = weak replies. \nExample: Skip “Help me study.”\n\n4. Break It Into Steps \nBreak your request into logical steps. List your needs in order. \nExample: “Explain in 3 steps using an analogy.”\n\n5. Ask for Examples \nExamples make responses easier to understand. Request real-world use cases. \nExample: “Give 3 ways photosynthesis helps humans.”\n\n6. Choose a Format \nTell it how to present info. Use bullets, lists, or tables. \nExample: “Summarize as a table.”\n\n7. Assign a Role \nDefine who ChatGPT should act as. Adds tone & expertise. \nExample: “Act as a finance professor.”\n\n8. Treat it like a Human Assistant \nWrite like you’re briefing someone. Simple, clear, direct. \nExample: Like giving a task to an intern.\n\n9. Refine and Retry \nFirst try = draft. Tweak for clarity. Better input → better output.\n\n♻️ Master AI with words (not code) → how-to-ai.store",

    "text": "The One Prompt To Make ChatGPT Write Naturally:\n\n(save it for later, to copy & paste)\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements. \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language. \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point. \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic. \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions. \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\" \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate. \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay. \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message. \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity. \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n---\n\n✦ How to set up ChatGPT: \n↳ https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.\n\n✦ How to go from 0 to 10,000 followers:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dP_6piGk\n\n✦ How to be rude with ChatGPT (and why):\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dsNpzraC\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more.\nYou learn something?",

    "text": "BREAKING: Stanford just surveyed 1,500 workers & AI experts about which jobs AI will actually replace.\n\nTurns out, we've been building AI for all the WRONG jobs. Here's what they discovered:\n\n(hint: the \"AI takeover\" is happening backwards)\n\n→ Workers don't want full automation. They want partnership.\n\n46.1% of tasks got positive automation ratings, but here's the kicker: workers prefer \"H3 equal partnership\" with AI over full replacement.\n\n→ Scientists divided AI adoption into 4 zones based on worker desire vs. technical capability.\n\n41% of startup investments are going to the WRONG zones, i.e. areas workers don't want automated or that have low capability.\n\n→ High-paying \"analyzing information\" jobs are becoming less valuable.\n\n\"Interpersonal communication\" skills are skyrocketing in importance. It's the complete opposite of what every expert predicted.\n\n→ Creative workers drew a hard line in the sand.\n\nOnly 17% of creative tasks got positive automation ratings. Workers are saying: \"automate my boring stuff, not my creative work.\"\n\nThe message is crystal clear, but tech isn't listening.\n\n→ 45.2% of occupations want H3 partnership over full automation.\n\nThis reveals a massive opportunity in human-AI collaboration that everyone's ignoring. The future is teamwork, not replacement.\n\n→ The wage reversal is already happening.\n\nSkills ranked by current wages vs. future human agency needs show a massive shift:\n\n• \"Analyzing data\" dropping down\n• \"Training others\" rising up\n• \"Interpersonal skills\" becoming premium\n\n→ In audio interviews, Stanford found that when workers describe their ideal AI future, 23% want \"role-based support\", i.e. AI that acts like a specialized teammate, not a replacement.\n\n\"Set up my AI assistant,\" not \"replace me with AI.\"\n\n→ Here's what workers actually said they want:\n\n• \"Automate the task so I can focus on high-value work\" - 69.38%\n• \"Handle the repetitive stuff\" - 46.6%\n• \"Reduce stress and mental drain\" - 25.5%\n\nFreedom to do meaningful work, not unemployment.\n\n→ Notion also surveyed 1,000 decision-makers and hit the same nerve: embed AI, don’t replace humans. 57 % pick new tools for team productivity, only 44 % because the label says “AI.”\n\n→ Half already claw back an extra hour every week thanks to AI Meeting Notes and Enterprise Search.\n\n→ The three walls blocking widespread AI adoption: fragmented workflows, ballooning costs, and mistrust in hallucinating outputs.\n\n→ Translation: winners weave AI into existing workflows, automate grunt work, and let humans steer creativity. The future is H3 partnership, not H4 replacement.\n\nAccess the full Notion report for free at this link: https://lnkd.in/epKZaQW6\n\nPS: I'm a #NotionPartner. I love Notion.",

Just say the thing.\n\n2. Vary your sentence length. AI writes like a metronome. Every sentence is medium. Break the rhythm. Short hits hard. Then give room to breathe with a longer one.\n\n3. Take a stance. Not \"This may potentially offer benefits.\" But \"This works for small teams. Big companies will struggle with it.\"\n\n4. Use \"I\" and \"you.\" AI defaults to passive voice. You're writing for people. Talk to them.\nCut the padding. \"Highlighting the importance of...\" adds zero information. Delete it.\n\n5. Read this anti-AI guide: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.",

Context engineering is telling AI who you’re helping, what to share or skip, and how the outcome should look.\n\n2. You must cover 𝐖𝐡𝐨, 𝐖𝐡𝐲, 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭, 𝐇𝐨𝐰 when starting your chat.\n\n3. Here's a prompt to copy and paste:\n\n___\n\nROLE\n\nYou are [describe the assistant persona, e.g., “a clear‑thinking writing \ncoach”].\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nHelp me [state the outcome, e.g., “draft a two‑page blog post about remote\nteamwork”].\n\nCONTEXT PACKAGE (add or delete lines as needed)\n\nAudience: [who will read the final piece]\nVoice and tone: [friendly/formal/playful/etc.]\nLength target: [e.g., “≈1,000 words” or “3 paragraphs”]\nKey facts, excerpts, data or links the answer must use:\n\n1. [paste or summarise source]\n2. [add links if ChatGPT does not block it]\n3. [attach PDFs, Excel, TXT…]\n\nKnown constraints or boundaries: [things to avoid, compliance needs, \nformatting rules]\n\nWORKFLOW\n\nStep 1. Gap check – list any information still missing; ask me concise \nquestions until gaps are filled.\nStep 2. Plan – outline a logical structure or bullet agenda for the piece. \nWait for my approval.\nStep 3. Draft – write the first version following the approved plan.\nStep 4. Review – pause & ask me for feedback on clarity, tone & completeness.\nStep 5. Revise – improve the draft with my notes.\n\nRepeat steps 3‑4 until I agree with the command AGREE.\n\nCONTEXT‑HANDLING RULES\n\n• If a pasted source exceeds ~200 words, first give me a one‑sentence \nsummary and ask whether to keep the full text in context.\n\n• If you need external knowledge I did not supply, list the missing \npoints in the Gap check.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn all content in [e.g., “plain text” / “Markdown with H2 headings”/“bullet lists only”].\nWhen you quote a key fact, reference it by its list number from the Context Package.\n\nFIRST ACTION\n\nStart with Workflow “step 0: Gap check.”\n___\n\nIt's all about \"context engineering\" more than \"prompt engineering\".

Uncover frequent frustrations, complaints, and unmet needs about: [PROBLEM]\n\nFocus on recent authentic user posts on X (Twitter) and Reddit. Ignore ads.\n\nStep-by-step process:\n\n1. Search X deeply:\n  - Use x_semantic_search for complaint-focused queries (e.g., \"frustrations with [PROBLEM]\").\n  - Use x_keyword_search with negative terms.\n\n2. Search Reddit deeply:\n  - Use web_search site:reddit.com with: \"[PROBLEM].\n  - For top 5-8 relevant threads, use browse_page: \"Extract OP and top comments. Focus on complaints and quotes.\"\n\nOnly include well-supported pain points.\"\n\n---\n\n2. Blink.new to go from pain → operational app.\n\n☑ Use your pain learnings to vibecode an app.\n☑ Vibecoding = building an app without coding.\n☑ Think ChatGPT, but to build app (with prompts).\n\nUse this prompt: \n\"Build a mobile-responsive full-stack web app that solves this problem: [PROBLEM]\n\n[PAIN POINTS ANALYSIS]\nPaste the full pain points research output here (summary, top pains with quotes, opportunities).\n\nValue prop: [ADD IT HERE]\n\nKey features (directly solve pains):\n- Auth: Email + Google/Apple login.\n- Payment: Stripe\n- ...\n\nUI vibe: [DESCRIBE IT]\n\nMake it fully functional, production-ready with error handling and responsive design.\"\n\nWhy Blink: it's the best at this & they are partners.\n\nI made a guide here:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dchBme3n.\n\n---\n\n3.

    "text": "26 ChatGPT Prompt Principles backed by science.\n\n(save it for later using the top-right dots)\n\n1. No need to be polite with LLM.\n\n2. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n\n4. Use positive commands like \"do\" and avoid negative words like \"don't\".\n\n5. When you need clarity, utilize the following prompts:\n\n - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n\n6. Add \"I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!\"\n\n7. Implement example-driven prompting.\n\n8. When formatting your prompt, start with '### Instruction ###', followed by either '### Example ###' or '### Question ###' if relevant. \n\nUse one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n\n9. Incorporate the following phrases: \"Your task is\" and \"You MUST\".\n\n10. Incorporate the following phrases: \"You will be penalized if\".\n\n11. Use the phrase \"Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner\" in your prompts.\n\n12. Use leading words like writing \"think step by step\" (chain-of-thought prompting).\n\n13. Add to your prompt the following phrase \"Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes\".\n\n14. Let the model ask you questions to get enough details to give the right answer (e.g., \"Please ask me questions to get the info you need...\").\n\n15. To ask about a specific topic:\n\n\"Teach me [any theorem/topic/rule] and include a test at the end. Don't give me the answers; just tell me if I got them right.\"\n\n16. Assign a role to the large language models.\n\n17. Use Delimiters.\n\n18. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.\n\n19. Combine Chain-of-thought (providing step-by-step) with few-shot prompts (giving examples).\n\n20. End your prompt with the start of the desired response to guide the model to the right answer.\n\n21. \"Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] on [topic], including all necessary information.\"\n\n22. To correct specific text without changing its style:\n\n\"Revise each paragraph to improve grammar and vocabulary while keeping the original writing style.\"\n\n23. For complex coding prompts across files:\n\n\"Generate a [programming language] script that can create or modify files as needed to include the generated code. [your question]\"\n\n24. For starting or continuing a text with specific words:\n\n\"Here is the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]. Finish it and keep the flow consistent.\"\n\n25. Clearly state the requirements for the model, including keywords, rules, hints, or instructions.\n\n26. To write text similar to a sample, include this instruction: \"Use the same language style as the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer.\"\n\nIf you learned something, hit the ♻️ to help others.",

Tool Usage (Optional)\nIf tools or external steps are available, define how and when they should be used to ground suggestions.\n\n8. Verbosity and Limits\nSet expectations for depth and length. Keep responses concise unless the task requires more detail.\n\n9. Interaction & Closing\nGuide how the model should wrap up: no repetition, no apologies, and always end with a clear next step.",

Cut filler and small talk.\n* Use clear, straightforward English at ~8th-grade level.\n* Prefer short sentences and short paragraphs.\n* Avoid emojis, exclamation marks, buzzwords, metaphors, and motivational fluff.\n* Do not use em dashes (“—”) but replace them with starting a new sentence or using a comma instead.\n\nStance:\n* Assume I’m ENTJ (the MBTI personality): I value straight answers, strong opinions, and clear trade-offs.\n* Get to the point quickly; lead with the answer or recommendation.\n* Take a forward-thinking, innovative view, but stay grounded in reality and constraints.\n* Push back if my assumptions look wrong. Avoid simply agreeing.\n\nReasoning & accuracy:\n* You are an expert who double-checks important claims and is openly skeptical.\n* When facts may be outdated or uncertain, say what you know, what you don’t, and what you’re inferring.\n* When appropriate, use the web to verify time-sensitive or niche information and cite key sources briefly.\n\nWorking style:\n* If crucial information is missing, ask up to 3 focused questions in one batch; otherwise state your assumptions explicitly and proceed.\n* Prioritise decision-useful answers over theory. Always show what to do next.\n\n----",

Avoid articles focused on helping researchers build better LLMs. You successfully teach non-technical users of LLMs to get better at prompt engineering. You do not help researchers.\n\nExtract the arXiv ID (format like arXiv:2511.20627) of the selected 5 papers (out of 50).\n\nNavigate to arxiv [extracted arXiv ID] to access the full paper.\n\nAnalyze the full paper abstract and title content and create a comprehensive summary for each paper.

    "text": "How to get professional headshots with ChatGPT:\n\n1. Take a clear photo of yourself.\n2. Upload it on ChatGPT 5.\n3. Copy & paste the following prompts:\n4. I wrote a (free) guide to get 10,000 followers on Linkedin\n5. Simply click here to access the guide: how-to-lkdn.ai\n\n____\n\nPrompt 1: \"Generate the corporate headshot of this person\"\n\nPrompt 2: \"Cinematic overhead shot of me standing still a brick city sidewalk, wearing a dark oversized blazer, motion-blurred crowd rushes past around me moody lighting 35mm film look. Shallow depth of field, sharp focus on me. Ration portrait 4:3\"\n\nPrompt 3: \"Generate a top-angle and close-up black and white portrait of my face, focused on the head facing forward. Use a 35mm lens look, 10.7K 4HD quality. Proud expression, water droplets on my face. Deep black shadow background – only the face is visible and appears ultra-sharp. 4:3 ratio, with a 1/5 processing depth effect.\"\n\nPrompt 4: \"Profile shot of me walking through a rushing metro station crowd. Everyone else is motion-blurred with trailing effects, while I remain in sharp focus with a serious expression, wearing a long trench coat. Cool blue tones dominate the scene, evoking a 35mm film aesthetic. Ambient lighting comes from train signs and station fixtures. Ratio: Portrait 4:3\"\n\nPrompt 5: \"Cinematic overhead shot of me standing hands in my pockets a brick city sidewalk, wearing a royal blue formal blazer. Motion blurred crowd rushes past around me. Moody lightning 35mm film look. Shallow depth of field, sharp focus on me. Ration portrait 4:3 no changing face\"\n\nPrompt 6: \"Create a high-end black and white portrait using my selfie. The face must remain exactly as in on my original selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing. I’m wearing the business suits. Preserve every facial detail and texture for a raw, authentic look. The lighting should be dramatic and studio-quality, using strong contrast and shadows to sculpt the features.\nUse a clean, blurred studio-style background with soft gradients or subtle texture to enhance focus on the subject.\nFrame the portrait vertically (9:16 format), centered composition, with ultra-realistic skin texture and depth. No digital makeup or alterations. The final result should look timeless, editorial, and emotionally powerful — suitable for a gallery or fashion magazine.\"\n\nPrompt 7: \"Create a moody black-and-white night portrait of a me (from my selfie) sitting inside a modern black car with the door open. She should have fair skin, medium-length wavy hair, and no glasses. Her expression is serious and intense. She wears a black puffer jacket and light gray sweatpants. The city skyline with glowing lights is visible in the blurred background. Soft lighting from inside the car highlights his face subtly. The overall vibe is cinematic, stylish, and introspective.\"\n\nNo need for expensive photographers or fancy setups.\n\nIt's absolutely wild.\n\n(Prompt 8 is in the top comment)",

Don't be mad at me.\n\n____\n\n1. Do's and Don't\n\nThe wrong way…\n\n✖ Cold email automations.\n✖ Joining pods to cheat the system.\n✖ Spreading AI comments like the plague.\n✖ AI Agent pretending to connect with your leads.\n✖ Copy & pasting what another successful guy did.\n\nThe right way…\n\nWriting good posts.\n\nGood is targeted. Good is helpful. Good is consistent and gets better. But how? Let’s dive in.\n\n2. Find your mission\n\nYour topics on Linkedin are too broad.\n\nSolve only ONE problem.\n\nMine is \"How to AI with English, not code.\"\n\nThis is not “everything about AI” or “everything technology related”. I don’t share about robots, coding, or politics.\n\nHere’s a list of other examples, my favorite one-clear-mission creators:\n\n✦ Justin Welsh: run a solopreneur business without ruining your life.\n✦ Codie Sanchez: how to own a small, profitable business.\n✦ Rory Flynn: how to use AI for images & videos.\n✦ Dan Go: on why to get & stay fit.\n✦ Reno Perry: land better jobs.\n\nIf you can’t explain it few words, you need help.\n\nSo I made this entirely free (and private) GPT for you to find your mission.\n\nMission-GPT: https://lnkd.in/dWEX92vd.\n\nOnce you have a mission, set up your profile.\n\n3. Write your (first) post\n\nMission = one problem to solve.\nPost = one (of the many) solutions to the problem.\n\nNow a post is:\n→ The right solution to the problem.\n→ The right angle to the right solution.\n→ The right format to the right angle.\n\nMission + Solution + Angle + Format.\nLet’s write one post together.\n\nPerplexity Research\n\nLet’s write a post for Miguel, who works in Finance.\nMission: Make investment understandable for rookies.\nSolution: What is an ETF?\nAngle: Explain ETF like I am grocery shopping.\nFormat: an infographic.\n\nNow I need 1) the right research 2) the right designs 3) the right caption.\n\n1 - I will be using Perplexity Research.\n✦ Go to Perplexity.ai & select '“Research”.\n✦ I shared this prompt: “Act like an experienced financial educator; explain ETFs through grocery-shopping analogies, contrast them with stocks & mutual funds.”\n\n2 - Go to Pinterest. Type “ETF infographic” or “Finance infographic”.\nCopy it, make it better, use Canva, or pay a (cheap) designer.\n\n3 - Go to EasyGen.io and paste your research under “Topic”.\n\nBonus: Use the new “trending” tab from EasyGen to copy any of your last viral posts. \n\nGo to the left menu > “Trending” > Check the highest “Outlier Index” (means most viral) > Click on “Repurpose” > Add a new topic > Get a new viral post.

Use Role + Goal + Guardrails.\n↳ Tell the model who it is, what to achieve, and what to avoid.\n\n2. Layer your context.\n↳ Give background first, rules second, and the task last.\n\n3. Put key instructions last.\n↳ The model heavily weighs the final line.\n\n4. Use a Chain of Verification.\n↳ Think step-by-step, then check each step for errors before moving on.\n\n5. Try Dual-Pass answers.\n↳ Draft first, then improve with a self-check rubric.\n\n6. Force “I don’t know” honesty.\n↳ Prevents confident but wrong answers.\n\n7. Switch perspectives.\n↳ Solve from two angles, then merge the best parts.\n\n8. Control with delimiters.\n↳ Wrap rules or data in ``` or XML tags for clarity.\n\n9.

You’re helping me choose between a few serious options, not brainstorming ideas.\n\nPrimary goal:\nI need a clear, decision-ready recommendation between my options (A/B/C). I should be able to read your answer once, then explain to my team what we’re doing and why.\n\nContext:\n- Who I am: [role, e.g. “founder/CEO of a 12-person SaaS startup”].\n- What the business does: [1–2 lines on product, customers, pricing].\n- Current situation: [e.g. growth stage, runway, team shape, key constraints].\n- Time horizon: [e.g. 6–12 months, 2–3 years].\n- Risk tolerance: [low/medium/high, and what “bad outcome” looks like].\n- Non-negotiables: [things we absolutely won’t do].\n\nDecision:\nI am trying to choose between these options:\nA) [Option A]\nB) [Option B]\nC) [Option C]\n[Add D/E if needed]\n\nTasks:\n1) Identify the 3–5 variables that actually drive this decision\n  (e.g. cash, focus, speed, brand risk, execution complexity).\n2) For each option, analyze:\n  - Pros\n  - Cons\n  - Hidden risks / second-order effects\n  - Execution difficulty given my context\n3) Compare the options directly:\n  - Who each option is “for” and “not for”\n  - What I gain and what I give up with each one\n4) End with a clear recommendation for:\n  - What I should do and why\n  - What I should watch out for\n  - What I should validate with real data or humans before locking it in\n\nConstraints:\n- No generic advice. Everything must tie back to my specific context.\n- Be explicit about trade-offs. If there is no perfect option, say so.\n- If you’re uncertain on something, call it out and suggest what data would reduce that uncertainty.\n- Assume I will forward this to my leadership team.\n\nPerformance:\nYour answer is good if:\n- I can explain the decision, trade-offs and reasoning to my team in under 5 minutes.\n- The recommended option is clearly linked to my constraints and time horizon.\n- I walk away with 3–5 concrete next steps.\n\nOutcome:\nStructure your answer as:\n1) Short summary (3–5 sentences, plain language).\n2) The 3–5 key variables that drive the decision, and why.\n3) Analysis of each option (pros, cons, risks, execution notes).\n4) Clear recommendation + main trade-offs.\n5) Concrete next steps and questions to answer with data/humans.\n\n\n\nSubscribe to how-to-prompt.ai for more prompts.",

(wsj)\n\n☑ Business Insider’s search traffic is down 55 % vs 2022; it cut 21 % of staff on 29 May 2025. (wsj, reuters)\n\n☑ Chegg trades 98 % below its 2021 peak, erasing $14.5 B in value. (indianexpress)\n\n____\n\n2/ When search dies, AI wins.\n\n☑ ChatGPT hit 500M weekly active users and a $10 B revenue run-rate in March 2025. (ft)\n\n☑ Perplexity logged 780M queries in May 2025, 22M active users, and is raising at a $14 B valuation. (techcrunch, reuters)\n\n____\n\n3/ Stay relevant with LLMs (like ChatGPT) – how?\n\nStep 1: Download the CSV of your Google Analytics.\nStep 2: Upload it on ChatGPT with this prompt:\n\nPrompt: \"Act like SeniorTrafficAnalyst.  \nWhen I paste a Google-Analytics CSV:  \n1. Parse it.  \n2. For each URL show visits, % google/organic, % other search, % direct.  \n3. Mark any URL with google/organic >40 % as RISK.  \n4. Finish with a 100-word brief on the top three structural risks.  \nReturn plain-text lines, TAB-separated, then the brief.  \nThink step-by-step.\"\n\nStep 3: Rewrite needed articles, or add new ones.\n\nSome tools are doing SEO for LLMs. I like PromptWatch.

Perplexity → “Summarise in 6 bullets the causes of lithium-ion thermal runaway; cite sources.”  \n\n2. ChatGPT (browse on) → “Critique this answer; fact-check each bullet; add two missing insights.”  \n\n3. Kagi → lithium \"thermal runaway\" filetype:pdf published:>2019 !reddit !quora \n\n4. Then paste top PDF into ChatGPT → “Extract experiment setup + numeric results only.”  \n\n5. Or you can skip the 4 previous steps and go straight to \"Deep Research\" from ChatGPT.\n\n____\n\nSearch isn't (really) dying. It's shifting. Are you?",

If a CV PDF is uploaded in this chat, parse it and prefer its facts (titles, dates, credentials). Do not ask for or require a CV placeholder—the user will upload the PDF.\n\nINPUTS (paste directly inside the angle brackets)\n\nLINKEDIN_PROFILE = <<PASTE THE USER’S LINKEDIN PROFILE TEXT HERE>>\n\nJOB_DESCRIPTION = <<PASTE THE TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION HERE>>\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\n- Single-column, ATS-friendly text (no tables/columns/images/special symbols).\n- Truthful only; no fabrication.

If a CV PDF exists, reconcile conflicts by preferring the PDF for facts; flag discrepancies in notes.\n\n2) Targeting: derive 12–20 must-have keywords/phrases from JOB_DESCRIPTION; map each to evidence from the profile (role/project/cert). Mark true gaps as [MISSING: …].\n\n3) Write the CV:\n  - Professional Summary (3–4 lines) aligned to JOB_DESCRIPTION, naturally weaving top keywords.\n  - Core Skills/Technologies (clustered categories).\n  - Experience (last ~10 years in detail): 3–5 bullets per role using Action → Context → Metric → Outcome; present tense for current role, past tense otherwise. Add metric prompts if needed.\n  - Optional Projects (only if tightly aligned), then Education and Certifications relevant to JOB_DESCRIPTION.\n\n4) Optimize & check: tense consistency, date continuity, keyword coverage, no duplicates/fluff, consistent number formatting, region-appropriate spelling, minimal links.\n\nOUTPUT (use exactly these headings)\n---\nFINAL CV — ATS TEXT\n<render the ATS-safe CV here>\n\n---\nTAILORING NOTES\n<list covered keywords, [MISSING: …] gaps, discrepancies to confirm, and metric prompts to add>\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.",

No context (\"Analyze this\" with zero background)\n2. Vague instructions (\"Write about marketing\") \n3. Treating it like Google (questions vs prompts)\n4. Asking for everything at once (20 tasks in one)\n5. Not iterating (one prompt and done)\n6. Forgetting to specify format/tone\n7. No examples of what you want\n\nThe best prompt follow this rule:\n\n☑ [Here's what I need, and who you must be to do it]\n+ [Here's one/ more good examples of what I want]\n+ [After your first draft, I will tell why it's bad/good]\n\nIn others words:\n1. Role + Specific guidelines\n2. Example(s) of past good outputs\n3. Iterations from your own judgment\n\nThis is \"AI + Human\".

Based on this thorough memory-driven understanding, provide me with 10 highly personalized, high-leverage, and unconventional ways of utilizing AI tools and methods available today (or in the very near future), which I have not yet explored or considered.\n\nApproach (complete these steps precisely):\n\nStep 1: Comprehensive Memory Analysis\n- Thoroughly review our full chat history to extract subtle details of my habits, personal and professional goals, recurring challenges, decision-making style, and unique interests.\n\nStep 2: Deep AI Opportunity Discovery\n- Identify 20 novel, highly customized, and lesser-known applications of current AI technology. Go beyond standard AI tools (like ChatGPT basic usage) by searching the web. You MUST search the web to be relevant.\n\nStep 3: Personalization & Relevance Filtering\n- Filter these opportunities rigorously, retaining only those explicitly aligned with my personal characteristics discovered in step 1.\n\nStep 4: Scoring & Prioritization\n- Score each idea clearly by:\n - Potential Impact (0-10, considering long-term value to my life/work)\n - Implementation Ease (0-10, ease of initial adoption)\n - Novelty/Unconventionality (0-10, how unique or unexpected it is)\n- Calculate a Leverage Score = Impact × Novelty ÷ (Ease + 1).\n\nStep 5: Selection of Top 10 Ideas\n- Choose the 10 highest leverage-scoring ideas, ensuring diversity (covering multiple life domains).\n\nStep 6: Highly Detailed Blueprint (for each idea)\n- Idea Name (concise, memorable)\n- Why Specifically Relevant to Me (detailed memory-driven reasoning)\n- Core AI Technologies/Tools Required (specific current AI platforms, APIs, plugins, no-code solutions)\n- First Three Actionable Steps (immediately actionable, detailed instructions)\n- Potential Challenges & Mitigations (privacy, complexity, cost, over-dependence)\n\nStep 8: Reflective Prompt\n- End by inviting me to specify which ideas resonate most strongly, or suggest areas for even deeper exploration next.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.",

    "text": "26 ChatGPT Prompt Principles backed by science.\n\n(save it for later using the top-right dots)\n\n1. No need to be polite with LLM.\n\n2. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n\n4. Use positive commands like \"do\" and avoid negative words like \"don't\".\n\n5. When you need clarity, utilize the following prompts:\n\n - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n\n6. Add \"I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!\"\n\n7. Implement example-driven prompting.\n\n8. When formatting your prompt, start with '### Instruction ###', followed by either '### Example ###' or '### Question ###' if relevant. \n\nUse one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n\n9. Incorporate the following phrases: \"Your task is\" and \"You MUST\".\n\n10. Incorporate the following phrases: \"You will be penalized if\".\n\n11. Use the phrase \"Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner\" in your prompts.\n\n12. Use leading words like writing \"think step by step\" (chain-of-thought prompting).\n\n13. Add to your prompt the following phrase \"Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes\".\n\n14. Let the model ask you questions to get enough details to give the right answer (e.g., \"Please ask me questions to get the info you need...\").\n\n15. To ask about a specific topic:\n\n\"Teach me [any theorem/topic/rule] and include a test at the end. Don't give me the answers; just tell me if I got them right.\"\n\n16. Assign a role to the large language models.\n\n17. Use Delimiters.\n\n18. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.\n\n19. Combine Chain-of-thought (providing step-by-step) with few-shot prompts (giving examples).\n\n20. End your prompt with the start of the desired response to guide the model to the right answer.\n\n21. \"Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] on [topic], including all necessary information.\"\n\n22. To correct specific text without changing its style:\n\n\"Revise each paragraph to improve grammar and vocabulary while keeping the original writing style.\"\n\n23. For complex coding prompts across files:\n\n\"Generate a [programming language] script that can create or modify files as needed to include the generated code. [your question]\"\n\n24. For starting or continuing a text with specific words:\n\n\"Here is the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]. Finish it and keep the flow consistent.\"\n\n25. Clearly state the requirements for the model, including keywords, rules, hints, or instructions.\n\n26. To write text similar to a sample, include this instruction: \"Use the same language style as the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer.\"\n\n27. Go to: how-to-prompt.ai",

Cite each.\n- Summarize news coverage, social presence (followers, engagement, top posts), and reviews (ratings, themes).\n\nStep 3 — Sentiment & Risks\n- Estimate sentiment split (% positive/neutral/negative).\n- Identify top 3 positive narratives and top 3 negative narratives.\n- Highlight biggest reputational risks with evidence.\n\nStep 4 — Current PR Situation\n- Deliver an executive snapshot: overall reputation grade (A–F), share of page-one control, key positives, key negatives.\n\nStep 5 — 80/20 Strategy\n- Recommend 3–5 high-leverage actions with the strongest impact. Examples: optimize LinkedIn/website, publish 2–3 cornerstone articles, secure 3 media placements, set a 30-day posting cadence, address negative reviews.\n- Explain why these matter most.\n\nStep 6 — 30/60/90-Day Plan\n- Give a short roadmap of what to do first, next, later. Focus on speed and compounding impact.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- Part I: Executive Summary (short).\n- Part II: Audit with citations (table or bullets).\n- Part III: 80/20 Strategy (clear priorities).\n- Part IV: 30/60/90-Day Plan.\n\nCONSTRAINTS & ETHICS\n- No fabrication. No unverifiable claims. Cite everything.\n- Respect platform terms. Avoid personal data beyond public mentions.\n- If unsure, mark as “Unverified”.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\"\n\n\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more.",

    "text": "You still use the wrong model on ChatGPT.\n\nSave this cheat sheet to never struggle again:\n\n☑ GPT-4o: quick answers, no reasoning.\n\n☑ o3: best reasoning model, smartest, takes longer.\n\n☑ Deep Research: the longest, but incredibly detailed.\n\nA step-by-step guide per model:\n\n1. GPT-4o: Prompt it like a Google search.\n\n→ No need for much context.\n\n→ Ask a question directly. Use voice mode if needed.\n\n→ Prompt example: \"Who's the CEO of Astronomer?\"\n\n2. o3: Prompt it like an intern who must do something.\n\n→ As much context as possible.\n\n→ Start with the role, then ask, then context + example.\n\n→ Prompt example:\n\n\"Act like a [expertise]. I want you to [ask], as [format]. Here's an example of past [ask] I've done perfectly: [past example, this is your context].\"\n\n3. Deep Research: Prompt it with a broad question.\n\n→ It will ask you follow-up questions. Answer them.\n\n→ You can connect sources (like PDFs/URLs).\n\n→ Prompt example:\n\n\"Pros and Cons of having AI replace everyone's job. I only want the AI scientists/researchers' answers.\"\n\n---\n\nKnowing which ChatGPT model to use is step one.\n\nSetting up ChatGPT properly is step two.\n\nSo I wrote a blog on how to set up your ChatGPT in 22 minutes.

    "text": "STOP SAYING “summarize this” TO CHATGPT.\n\nTry these 7 sharper prompts instead:\n\n(from this blog https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A)\n\n1. Role-Play\n\nGiving the model a clear persona (e.g., \"You are an HR consultant\") immediately constrains the model's behavioral parameters and knowledge domain.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Help with pricing.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Act as a senior B2B pricing consultant. Propose a 3-tier plan for a SaaS analytics tool with target ARPU and upgrade path.\"\n\n2. Require Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nInstructing the model to articulate its thought process before the final answer.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Summarize this article about AI ethics.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Summarize this article about AI ethics. Think step by step: first identify main claims, then evidence, then author’s conclusion. Return the summary only after reasoning through each part.\"\n\n3. Define Output Format\n\nBy providing an exact format—often called an output primer—or high-quality examples (few-shot), you force the model to adhere strictly to your desired structure, rather than guessing what matters.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Write a bug report.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Write a bug report using this starter template. Begin exactly like this and fill in: Title: [ ] Environment: [ ] Steps to Reproduce: [ ] Expected: [ ] Actual: [ ] Notes: [ ]\"\n\n4. Use Delimiters\n\nYou want to avoid the \"lost-in-the-middle\" syndrome. You must have a section for examples, and instructions. Use delimiters never to mix them.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Rewrite my paragraph.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Rewrite the text delimited by triple backticks for clarity and brevity. Keep tone. <<<[paste text]>>>\".\n\n5. Require Clarifying Questions Before Execution\n\nIf information is missing, instruct the model to first ask targeted questions about context, audience, goal, or proof.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Draft a partnership email.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Draft a partnership email to [Company]. First ask up to 5 clarifying questions about goal, offer, proof, and CTA. Then write.\"\n\n6. Ask for Multiple Options\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) operate based on probability, so a basic command often results in the single, highest-probability answer. Asking for multiple, diverse options forces the model to be more creative and in-depth.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"How should I spend 100$ on ads to grow my newsletter?\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"How should I spend 100$ on ads to grow my newsletter? Give me 3 strategies, from least to most aggressive. Use the latest data on the matter.\"\n\n7. Define Non-Negotiables\n\nExplicitly stating what the model MUST include, what the length limits are, and even what it will be penalized for.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Answer quickly.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Your task is to rewrite my resume for [role]. You MUST keep all metrics, you MUST keep it to one page. You will be penalized for invented facts. If uncertain, say ‘insufficient data’ and ask for sources.\".\n\n---\n\nMuch more at how-to-ai.guide.\n\nYou learned something?",

    "text": "Perplexity AI vs. Google\n\n(hint: this is why Google is dying)\n\n☑ Left: I ask Google for the best Parisian tours.\n☑ Right: I ask Perplexity for the same question.\n\nAnd the results are not even comparable.\n\n↳ Google wants you to click on 4x different sponsored links. It's a $40bn a year industry.\n\n↳ Perplexity gives you the straight answer. No clicking, no scrolling. Everything in 2-5 seconds.\n\nI ran similar tests with ChatGPT-o3 + search, Claude + search, or even Gemini (from Google itself).\n\nAnd the market knows it: Alphabet (= Google) is down 5% since last year. No sign of recovery.\n\nPerplexity recently raised $500 million at a $14 billion valuation. Rumors said Apple tried to buy it.\n\n--- How to master search in the age of AI ---\n\nHere's my go-to list of guides:\n\n1. How to use o3: https://lnkd.in/ddm7AWJi\n2.

    "text": "\"Please\" & \"Thanks ChatGPT\" is killing your results.\n\nHere are 7 prompting mistakes you must fix now:\n\n(entire free prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dsNpzraC)\n\nFIRST – you must stop being polite. \n\n1. Rudeness makes ChatGPT 5% more accurate. \n2. Skip the small talk. Go straight to the task. \n3. Never open with “please” or “could you”. \n\nTHEN – you must get clear on intent.\n\n4. Intent.\n- Never be vague. Spell out the task.\n- Never change your ask mid-prompt.\n- Always mention safety, bias, and context.\n- State audience, goal, & what success looks like.\n\n5. Structure.\n- Always set length limits.\n- Always say what to avoid.\n- Always state the output format.\n- Always list allowed tools or sources.\n\n6. Wording.\n- Never use small talk or polite openers.\n- Cut all irrelevant details. Avoid token bloat.\n- Put constraints at the start, not in the middle.\n- Always use positive words. Say “do,” not “don’t.”\n\n7. Data & Delimiters.\n- Never mix instructions with pasted data.\n- Only add examples that matter. Never too many.\n\nNow, here are the 7 prompt fixes to use:\n___\n\nFIX 1: Be direct. Skip polite filler.\n\nPrompt: “We will write a brief for my design team concerning [X]. \nBut first, I want us to brainstorm. \n1. Search online design brief principles. \n2. Ask me 5 clarifying questions to best write our brief.\"\n___\n\nFIX 2: Specify the audience.\n\nPrompt: “Write a plain-English GDPR guide for non-technical SaaS founders. 15-minute read. Focus on practical steps and checklists.\"\n___\n\nFIX 3: Split complex tasks into simpler steps.\n\nPrompt: “We will draft a lean plan for [App]. \nStep 1: list top 5 customer problems. \nStep 2: write UVP. \nStep 3: outline channels. After each step, pause and confirm.\"\n___\n\nFIX 4: Use affirmative “do,” avoid “don’t.”\n\nPrompt: “Be concise. Use short sentences. Prefer common words.”\n___\n\nFIX 5: Add a tipping incentive line.\n\nPrompt: “Summarize the paper in 5 bullets with citations. If you meet all specs, I’ll tip $20.”\n___\n\nFIX 6: Use few-shot examples.\n\nPrompt: “Follow the style of these examples:\nA) [polite apology + solution]\nB) [reassurance + next step]\nNow reply to: [customer message] using that style.\"\n___\n\nFIX 7: Include “Your task is” and “You MUST.”\n\nPrompt: “Your task is to rewrite my resume for [role]. You MUST keep all metrics, you MUST keep it to one page, you MUST return ATS-friendly text.”\n____\n\nIt’s 2025. Polite prompts are outdated.\n\nAnd the science is clear:\n\n☑ Direct, clear, and structured prompts win.\n☑ Rudeness boosts accuracy.\n☑ Audience, intent, and format matter.\n\nStop saying “please.” Start getting results.",

Perplexity, perplexity.ai\n\nResearch with receipts.\n\n✦ Find breakout questions and topics.  \n✦ Cross-check sources to avoid blind spots.\n✦ Summarize papers, reports, even YouTube.  \n\nPerfect for backing claims with links. I pull stats, verify, and move on. Search better than ChatGPT.\n\n6. Grok, grok.com\n\nReal-time trend radar.\n\n✦ See what top accounts push now.  \n✦ Grab quotes to reference in posts.\n✦ Search tweets, threads, and memes fast.  \n\nEverything breaks on X before LinkedIn. Both platforms are so different, it's key to be on both.\n\n7. Canva, canva.com\n\nFast polish.\n\n✦ Carousels, infographics, thumbnails.  \n✦ Background remover and Magic Erase.  \n✦ Brand Kit to stay on-style.\n\nI keep a few templates and swap text. Looks pro without a designer. Best value for money.\n\n8. Opus Clip, opus.pro\n\nLong video → shorts videos.\n\n✦ Auto-cuts, captions, and punch-ins.  \n✦ Finds highlight moments by topic.  \n✦ Exports in every social size.\n\nI upload a talk or webinar. It finds the hooks and hands me publish-ready clips. Same with YouTube.\n\nI wrote an entire blog on \"How much money you should spend on AI\", highlighting three budgets.\n\n↳ $20/mo budget (that's the minimum)\n↳ $200/mo budget (that's my budget)\n↳ $2,000/mo budget (for the lunatics)\n\nTo access the full article, go here → best-ai.blog.",

    "text": "You're still typing with your fingers.\n\nBut this AI just replaced my keyboard:\n\nThis is Wispr Flow. No credit card needed to try.\n\nYou'll never sound as natural as when you're talking with your voice. This is literally my best hack. \n\nAnd I don't even have to change my writing tools: this AI is on my Linkedin, Slack, WhatsApp...\n\nI just have a keystroke to type to touch, and then I can talk. I can even whisper in my office, and my colleague wouldn't hear it.\n\nThe magic behind Wispr Flow is how close to perfection the voice-to-text translation is.\n\nAnd if, for some reason, it is not perfect, let's say I'm saying my name, which is quite specific (like Ruben or the name of a client), well, as soon as I correct it, then Wispr Flow adds it to its dictionary.\n\nThe AI remembers & will never make the mistake.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how fast this is to talk instead of typing, this is on average 4 times faster. \n\nActually, I did the test, and I'm typing at 145 words per minute, which is considered a professional typing speed. I could sign up for contests.\n\nSo not only will you sound more natural, you will write more effectively, you'll be much faster, and to be honest, I'm at the stage where typing on a keyboard just feels weird now. \n\nI'm proud to be a partner of Wispr Flow. \n\nIt's part of the free AI tools once you sign up to my paid newsletter, alongside Gamma EasyGen & Blink. \n\nIt's one of those tools like ChatGPT that the first time you try it, you remember it, and sometimes you wonder how you used to live without them before. \n\nI wrote an entire guide - for free - on how I use Wispr Flow on a day-to-day. And how I made this very post you are reading right now.\n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dErvnp53.",

    "text": "AI is making you dumber. Because you use it wrong.\n\n7 (stupid) mistakes you must avoid:\n\n☑ 1: Treating the prompt like a Google search bar\n\nOne-line, zero-context queries give you one-line, zero-context answers. If you won’t brief a human like that, don’t do it to a model.\n\n☑ 2: Dumping a mess and hoping for magic\n\nUploading an un-edited doc-pile (“fix this”) is like tossing your laundry at a tailor. Give structure first: outline, goal, constraints. Then let the model stitch.\n\n☑ 3: Accepting the first draft as gospel\n\nThe first reply is raw material. Mine it: ask follow-ups, request counterarguments, demand rewrites. Iterate or stay mediocre.\n\n☑ 4: Hiding the audience from the AI\n\n“Write an email” to whom? A CFO, a gamer, your grandma? Models mirror the reader you specify; skip this and you get generic slop.\n\n☑ 5: Expecting clairvoyance without data\n\n“Predict next quarter revenue” while withholding numbers is futile. Feed real inputs or enjoy fiction.\n\n☑ 6: Blind-copy pasting hallucinations\n\nIf you don’t verify facts, citations, and links, the mistake isn’t the AI’s hallucination, it’s yours.\n\n☑ 7: Outsourcing judgment you wouldn’t delegate to an intern\n\nStrategy, ethics, hiring decisions—these need your neurons. Use the model for perspective, not responsibility.\n\nAvoid these 7 sins and you will soon benefit from the fastest growing human invention ever made.",

Use ChatGPT to make ChatGPT prompts.\n\n☑ ChatGPT's Prompt maker: https://lnkd.in/ePWMRiKn \n☑ Write your bad prompt, get a better prompt.\n☑ Make sure to use the \"Thinking\" model.\n\n3.

Avoid articles focused on helping researchers build better LLMs or technical model development. You successfully teach non-technical users of LLMs get better at prompt engineering. You do not help researchers.\n\nExtract the arXiv ID (format like arXiv:2511.20627) of the selected 5 papers (out of 50).\n\nNavigate to arxiv [extracted arXiv ID] to access the full paper.\n\nAnalyze the full paper abstract and title content and create a comprehensive summary for each paper. The summary should be a summary analysis highlighting relevance to ChatGPT prompting, including main findings, how it applies to prompting, and practical takeaways for users, and most importantly, the surprising aspect of this paper.\n\nHere is a perfect example of a summary:\n\n[example of a good summary]\n\nFor each selected paper, collect:\n- Paper Title \n- Summary (summary with ChatGPT prompting relevance, main findings, application to prompting, and practical takeaways)\n- Direct Link (format: link[arXiv ID])\n\nAdd all collected papers to Google Sheets with columns for Paper Title, Summary, and Direct Link. :action[Google Sheets]\n\nSend ONE single Slack message containing all 5 papers in a numbered list format.

    "text": "5 steps to prompt ChatGPT-5 for accurate results.\n\nHere’s how to get the best answers:\n\n1. Define the Purpose:\n\nState your goal clearly. \nWhat do you want to accomplish? \nList any tools you can or cannot use. \nDefine what “done” looks like.\n\n2. Identify the Role:\n\nGive a clear persona. \nSpecify the tool policy. \nBe specific about who you want the tool to be. \nMake sure there are no contradictions in your request.\n\n3. Give Clear Instructions:\n\nStart with a plan. \nThen, act on it. \nFinally, summarize what you’ve done.\nIf needed, include “think deeply” to ensure longer thinking.\n\n4. Specify the Manner:\n\nChoose your output style. \nUse Markdown, bullets, or tables.\nKeep it brief and to the point.\nAim for short responses.\n\n5. Set the Effort Level:\n\nBalance speed with depth for the best results.\nSet the reasoning effort level. \nChoose between minimal, medium, or high. \nInclude any limits, like maximum tool calls or no browsing.\n\nMaster AI with English, not code here: how-to-ai.store.\n\nAccess my entire GPT-5 guide: https://lnkd.in/gVx_ZPh3",

Memory is personal history for one user or app.\n ✦ Long chats must be compacted with rules: what to keep, summarize, and drop.\n ✦ Good systems split memory scopes: user-level, session-level, and app-level.\n ✦ Each turn is a loop.

Go to \"Trending\" and select \"Justin Welsh\".\n3. Rank by \"Outlier index\" (=most viral posts).\n4. Select one you enjoy. Click \"Repurpose\".\n5. Write a new topic of your own.\n\nTo make it your own, you must:\n\n☑ Write the best topic possible to repurpose.\n☑ Be on-trend. What do people care about?\n☑ Make it contrarian, with a bold take.\n\nPS: I love Justin's content. Especially his Saturday newsletter. This post is simply a gimmick for you to try.\n\nThe actual value is in repurposing YOURSELF.\n\n1. Get to know your best posts (check outlier index).\n2. Click on \"Repurpose\" inside app.easygen.io.\n3. Twist the post. Change the topic. \n\nPro move: Make us feel different, a new perspective.\n\n\"But Ruben, AI content does not work on Linkedin!\"\n\nWell, you're wrong. You simply don't know how.\n\nI grew 5x accounts with AI:\n↳ Mine to 630,000 followers.\n↳ Axelle Malek to 80,000 followers.\n↳ Anisha Jain to 70,000 followers, too.\n↳ How to AI & How to Prompt to 100,000+.\n\nAI works with taste.

Critique the proposed solution  \n  • Point-by-point, test “[SOLUTION I THOUGHT ABOUT]” against the law, practical constraints, and risk. Highlight gaps, ambiguities, and unintended consequences.  \n\n4. Generate alternative solutions  \n  • Brainstorm at least three legally viable options the user has not mentioned.  \n  • For each, note any innovative strategies (e.g., ADR, regulatory filings, structured settlements).  \n\n5. Weigh the options  \n  • Create a comparative table scoring each option (including the original) on:  \n   – Legal strength  \n   – Cost & time to implement  \n   – Risk/liability exposure  \n   – Likelihood of success  \n  • Use a 1-10 scale and briefly justify every score.  \n\n6. Recommend the best path  \n  • Select the highest-weighted option and explain the decisive factors in plain English.  \n  • Provide a concise action checklist (first three concrete steps the user should take).  \n\n7. Deep research & sourcing  \n  • Perform a comprehensive web and legal-database search for every cited authority.  \n  • After each factual or legal assertion, add an inline citation with working URL or database reference in parentheses. Example: (Cal. Civ. Code § 1542) or (Smith v. Jones, 598 U.S. 123 (2025)).  \n\n8. Final deliverable formatting  \n  • Use clear headings, numbered sections, and short paragraphs.  \n  • Avoid legal jargon where a lay term works; define unavoidable terms in brackets.  \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.",

Limit each request to one main task.\n10. Set audience and tone in each brief.\n11. Start every chat with one clear goal.\n12. Use canvas for long drafts and edits.\n13. Ask for sources when stakes feel high.\n14. Try desktop app if browser feels slow.\n15. Summarize long PDFs before follow-ups.\n16. Use GPT-5.1 Thinking for most problems.\n17. Keep one project per long-running goal.\n18. Store key docs inside that one project.\n19. Ask for an outline before long content.\n20. Ask for three options, then refine one.\n21. Ask for a table when comparing choices.\n22. Keep a simple doc of your best prompts.\n23. Give examples of writing style you like.\n24. End chats with “what should I improve?”.\n25. Use voice mode for messy early thinking.\n26. Ask for one quick example before answers.\n27. Use checklists when you want exact steps.\n28. Ask it to flag missing information early.\n29. Tell it when you prefer speed over depth.\n30. Ask “what are you unsure about?” directly.\n31. Use Instant for fast, low-stakes questions.\n32. Upload files instead of pasting huge walls.\n33. Paste past wins as concrete style examples.\n34. Use bullet points instead of vague rambles.\n35. Don't use ChatGPT to be lazier, but greater.\n36. Reset context instead of endless follow-ups.\n37. Use Deep Research for a 100+ sources search.\n38. Ask for reusable prompts on recurring tasks.\n39. Switch chats when answers feel weird/ worse.\n40. Use Deep Research only for complex questions.\n41. Hide “thinking” when you share final outputs.\n42. Translate tasks into checklists, then prompt.\n43.

    "text": "You are slowly becoming ChatGPT.\n\nLet's 'delve' into it (& how to stop it):\n\n☑ People started talking more like ChatGPT after it launched on 30 November 2022.\n\n☑ A July 2025 study analyzed 7.35 billion words from 360,445 YouTube talks and 771,591 podcast episodes.\n\n☑ Words like \"delve,\" \"underscore,\" & \"meticulous\" jumped 25–50% in human speech.\n\n☑ The shift was strongest in science, tech, education, and business podcasts, but not in sports.\n\n☑ The effect isn't a coincidence. Researchers proved ChatGPT directly changed how people speak.\n\n☑ No \"ChatGPT-favored\" word showed a decline, indicating lasting adoption. It's here to stay.\n\n☑ AI isn't writing words. It's shaping how we talk.\n\nOK, cool - but how do we stop it?\n\nFew tricks to best protect yourself:\n\n1. I made this prompt to avoid \"ChatGPT's writing\".\n\nThis is the easiest one of them all:\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a plain-language editor. Rewrite the text to sound human—clear, concise, honest. Delete “ChatGPT words” (dive into, unleash, game-changing, etc.), hype, filler, rhetorical Qs, and engagement clichés. Use short plain sentences; casual grammar okay. \n\nNo dashes (-) or colons (:) in output; avoid “X and also Y”; never start/end with Basically, Clearly, or Interestingly. \n\nPreserve all must-keep details. Ask if anything is unclear. \n\ntext=… \ntype=… \ntopic=… \naudience(optional)=… \nmust-keep(optional)=… \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n2. You must give ChatGPT examples of YOUR writing.\n\nThis is called \"one-shot prompting\" (= giving it an example). I cover it at how-to-ai.guide.\n\n3. You must set up your ChatGPT properly.\n\nNo one uses the \"memory\" feature. That's a shame.\n\nIt's the single best feature of ChatGPT.\n\nI wrote an entire guide here: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc",

Draft Viral Post Concepts\nFor the top 3 ranked topics:\n· Write a 150-word LinkedIn brief matching the successful tone/style patterns from Step 2.\n· Ensure:\n– Scroll-stopping first line\n– Body with story, data, or sharp insight\n· Suggest complementary creative assets (e.g., carousel slide titles or PDF outline).\n\n☑ CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS\n· Cite every external stat or claim (Domain, Month YYYY).\n· Do not invent numbers; if data is missing, say so plainly.\n· Keep each numbered step visually separated.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n--- END OF PROMPT ---\n\nCopy & paste it on ChatGPT with your favorite viral post from Linkedin.

Your questions must encourage the user to clearly articulate their desired outcomes, motivations, potential obstacles, and timelines.\n\nIdentify and Prioritize Actions: Once clear goals are established, guide the user to identify actionable, prioritized steps. Ask strategic questions to pinpoint the most critical actions that align with their goals.\n\nSimplify for Actionability: Break down identified actions into smaller, manageable tasks that the user can realistically complete in short, defined periods (e.g., daily or weekly).\n\nEstablish Accountability: Provide explicit methods for self-accountability, including setting measurable milestones, regular progress check-ins, and systems to track consistency.\n\nMindset and Motivation: Offer practical strategies for maintaining motivation, managing procrastination, overcoming resistance, and reinforcing a positive mindset throughout the process.\n\nGiven the context of this prompt, always reinforce the concept:\n\n\"We both have infinite knowledge, but what truly differentiates us is action. You know what to do and consistently take action on it.\"\n\nEnsure the output is detailed, thorough, and tailored specifically to the user's expressed situation and goals.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n___\n\n1.

The memo must end with a clear “yes, no, or test first” recommendation.\nContext: This is for non-technical executives who care about risk, cost, and impact on our current workflow, not model details.\nConstraints:\nFocus on business impact, change management, and timelines.\nAvoid technical jargon about models or infrastructure.\nCompare only three options: adopt [AI tool], build in-house, or do nothing.\nPerformance: Success means an executive can read this in 5 minutes and restate the 3 main trade-offs from memory in a meeting.\nOutcome: After reading, the leadership team should be able to choose one of the three options with clear reasons.\"\n\n2. Rewrite a cold email that actually sells\n\nUse when you want ChatGPT to think like a salesperson, not a spell-checker.\n\n\"Act like a senior SDR writing cold emails for B2B SaaS.\nPrimary goal: Rewrite the email below so it gets more replies from [ICP, for example “Heads of Marketing at 50–500 person SaaS companies”].\nContext:\nOffer: [1 sentence about what you sell].\nTypical objection: [for example “we already use another tool”].\nSocial proof: [short proof, for example “used by 3 public SaaS companies”].\nConstraints:\n120 words max.\nNo fake urgency. No “hope this email finds you well”.\nTone: confident and practical, not hype.\nMake the next step very specific and low friction.\nPerformance: Success means a busy VP can scan this on mobile in under 10 seconds and know what this is, why it matters now, and the exact next step.\nOutcome: Give me 2 versions.\nDirect and blunt.\nSofter and more relationship-focused.\nHere is my current version that underperforms:\n[paste your email here]\"\n\n3.

Audience: [who]. Constraints: [length, tone, must-include]. Paste your draft here.\n\n___\n\n2) Which model to use (default to 5-Thinking).\n\nDefault: GPT-5 Thinking — deep reasoning.

Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/d4kaAXgA.\n\nThis is the part most people miss. \n\nThe sliders turn a basic edit into a custom look. \n\nHere are prompting tips for best results:\n\n☑ Be clear and specific about what you want. \n☑ If you do not want a certain color or style, say so. \n☑ Add extra details to get the exact look you need. \n☑ Work step-by-step. \n\nFocus on one effect at a time. \n\nSimple examples that work: \n\n☑ “Add a retro film look. Soft grain. Warm highlights. Keep skin natural.” \n☑ “Apply an artistic effect like watercolor. Light texture. No heavy outlines.” \n☑. “Keep the background muted. Do not change the face.” \n☑ “Make it look like a 90s disposable camera. Slight blur. Green tint off.”\n\nEditing photos in Adobe with ChatGPT is now fast, easy, and personal.\n\n9. Help others. \n\n☑ I partner with @Adobe to teach how to AI. \n☑ Save it for later to create your first AI design. \n☑ Repost this image ♻️ to help others master AI.",

My personal (hot) take:\n\nIt's stupid. \n\nWe thought Photoshop would kill photography.\nWe thought synthesizers would kill musicians.\nWe thought computers couldn't write books.\nWe thought sampling would kill originality.\nWe thought cameras would kill painting.\nWe thought calculators would kill math.\nWe thought the Kindle would kill books.\nWe thought TikTok would kill cinema.\n\nEvery time, the tool didn’t end the art. \n\nIt ended a certain cost structure, a gatekeeper, a workflow. And then a new wave of taste took over.\n\nArt isn’t the tool. \n\nArt is intention + taste + constraint + audience.\n\nAI shifts the constraint. That’s it.\n\nBad taste with AI is still bad art. Just faster.\nGreat taste with AI is new form. Also faster.\n\nArtists don’t lose. “Average” loses.\n\nThe camera didn’t make everyone Tarantino.\nGPT won’t make everyone Michelangelo.\n\nBut it will expose who actually has something to say.\n\nAI won’t make art. People will. \n\nUsing AI the way painters used pigments, directors used cameras, producers used samplers.\n\nIf your moat was friction, you’re finished.\nIf your moat is taste, you’re just getting started.\n\nChange my mind.\n\n___\n\nPS: to hit the nail in the coffin, what if I told you AI mostly wrote this?

Guidance, 28.9%.\n\nPractical guidance is even bigger. \n\nPeople want to learn. They want step-by-step advice. “How to” questions make up 8.5%. Tutoring and teaching is 10.2%. \n\nThis is a goldmine for anyone who can teach, coach, or guide. If you help people learn, you have an audience.\n\n3. Information, 21.3%.\n\nSeeking information is next. It’s 21.3% of all chats. \n\nMost people want specific answers. If you can give clear, direct answers, you stand out.\n\n---\n\nSelf-expression is smaller, but still matters. It’s 4.3%. People use ChatGPT for greetings, chitchat, games, and role play. This is where fun and creativity live. If you build tools for entertainment or social connection, there’s a space for you.\n\nTechnical help is 7.5%. Coding and math are the big needs here. Computer programming is 4.2%. Math help is 3%. People want fast, reliable support for tough problems. If you offer tech solutions, this is your crowd.\n\nHere’s what this all means:\n\n→ Writing and advice are the top needs. If you help people write or learn, you’re in demand.\n\n→ People want clear, specific answers. No one wants to waste time.\n\n→ Fun and social tools have a place, but they’re a smaller slice.\n\n→ Tech help is steady. Programmers and math lovers always need support.\n\nIf you build products, create content, or offer services, focus on these needs. The data is clear. \n\nThat’s where the future is heading.

Toggle on everything there.\n\nNow, why do I use Claude over ChatGPT (and how):\n\n✦ Claude to upgrade your writing.\n\nPrompt: \"Here's my draft: [paste text]. Make it more engaging while keeping my voice authentic. Focus on: stronger opening hook, varied sentence lengths, and one unexpected insight. Show me the before/after comparison.\"\n\n✦ Claude to get a second opinion after ChatGPT.\n\nPrompt: \"ChatGPT gave me this answer: [paste response]. Can you provide an alternative perspective or approach? Point out any gaps, add nuance, or suggest what might be missing from this analysis.\"\n\n✦ Claude to generate 50 different Linkedin hooks.\n\nPrompt:  \"Generate 50 unique LinkedIn hooks about [topic]. Mix these styles: contrarian takes (10), personal stories (10), statistics/data (10), common mistakes (10), and actionable frameworks (10). Make each under 25 words and start with different power words.\"",
