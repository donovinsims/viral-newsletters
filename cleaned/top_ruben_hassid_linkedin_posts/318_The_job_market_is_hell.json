  "text": "The job market is hell.\n\nA guide to survive in the era of ChatGPT:\n\n1. Don't \"quick apply\" to jobs. \n\n☑ An AI wrote the CV.\n☑ Another AI quick applied to 1,000+ jobs.\n☑ And at the end, another AI read all of the CVs. \n\nThis is a dead-end, spiraling down more & more.\n\n2. Your Linkedin is your CV.\n\n☑ Personal branding isn't about being personal.\n☑ We don't care about your favorite breakfast.\n☑ Instead, share your (specific) expertise.\n\nAnd no, sharing expertise isn't bragging.\n\n1) Identify + 2) solve a problem 3) your future job would love to solve, 4) but shared on Linkedin.\n\n3. How to make a post.\n\n☑ Ask ChatGPT or Perplexity for specific problems to solve in your industry, solved in a specific way.\n\n☑ Go and try it yourself. Did you solve the problem?\n\n☑ Share it.\n\nDo it for 30 days & you'll receive some messages.\nDo it for 90 days & you'll get the one dream job.\nDo it for 365 days & you'll never apply for jobs.\n\n\n\nPS: I know I'm supposed to \"be the AI guy\".\n\nBut I'm also critical. I hate this part of AI.",
