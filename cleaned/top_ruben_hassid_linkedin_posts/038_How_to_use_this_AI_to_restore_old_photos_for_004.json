  "text": "How to use this AI to restore old photos for $0.04.\n\n1. Go to \"Replicate\".\n2. Click on \"flux-context-apps\" → \"restore-image\".\n3. On \"input_image\" → choose an image to restore.\n\n☑ What it is – restore-image is a ready-made FLUX Kontext app on Replicate that “restores, fixes scratches and damage, and colorizes old photos.\"\n\n☑ Runs & cost – Publicly available with ≈2 k runs so far and priced at about $0.04 per image on Replicate’s pay-as-you-go plan. \n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dY4S4K55\n\n☑ Commercial use – All FLUX Kontext apps hosted by Replicate, including restore-image, can be used in commercial projects. \n\n☑ Why it matters – No need to fine-tune or set up local GPUs; the heavy lifting happens on Replicate’s servers. Natural-language prompts remove Photoshop’s learning curve – perfect for archivists, genealogy buffs, or social media throwback posts.",
