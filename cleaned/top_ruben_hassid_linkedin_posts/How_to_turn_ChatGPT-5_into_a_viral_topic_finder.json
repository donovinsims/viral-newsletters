  "text": "How to turn ChatGPT-5 into a viral topic finder.\n\n1. Copy & paste this prompt:\n\nPrompt: \"Think very deeply. I need you to search the web. Act like a social media expert who needs to find 3x different angles for a new article. My niche is \"YOUR NICHE HERE\". A good article is: 1) A recent news story (which means in the last 3 days or so) that went viral and impacted my niche. Be creative. Sometimes, the right news is not exactly following the keywords of my niche. 2) An evergreen educational content that people need on my niche. Beware, it has to be extremely specific. For eg, \"How to use AI\" isn't specific but \"How to prompt Midjourney to get a realistic fashion show photoshoot\" is right for the niche \"AI tools for designers\". 3) Recent Reddit frustrations concerning my niche that went viral. Recent means in the last 7 days. You can also check in different languages.\"\n\n2. Ask to turn it into a content table (easier to read).\n\n3. Deep dive into one topic by asking follow-ups.\n\nThis prompt is step 1 of ChatGPT, for rookies.\n\nI wrote the next step on my blog, \"How to set up ChatGPT,\" properly. Because no one told you how.\n\nTo access it: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.\n\nThe table of content of my blog:\n\n✦ The method so ChatGPT knows you.\n✦ Why you must “One-Shot” prompts more often.\n✦ 6 examples of my own ChatGPT (with links).\n✦ Why you must use “Temporary chats”.\n✦ The 2 best ChatGPT alternatives.\n✦ How to create your own GPT.\n\nMy course is on this website: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.",
