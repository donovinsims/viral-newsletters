  "text": "I gained 331,689 followers this year, or 〜900 followers/day. If I had to start all over again, I would:\n\n✦ Be edgy. Be different.\n✦ Don't be personal. Be useful instead.\n✦ Use AI. Not to be lazier, but a better writer.\n\nGrowing an account is all about phases:\n\n→ 0-1,000: comment 100x per day, every day.\n→ 1,000-10,000: post every day, weekend included.\n→ 10,000-100,000: be known for one specific niche.\n→ 100,000-1M: if I think of [niche], I think of you.\n→ 1M+: build trillion-$ companies, like Microsoft.\n\nI wrote a much more extensive guide on how to go from 0 → 10,000 followers at how-to-lkdn.ai.",
