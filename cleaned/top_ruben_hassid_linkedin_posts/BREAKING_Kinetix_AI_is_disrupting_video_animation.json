  "text": "BREAKING: Kinetix AI is disrupting video animation.\n\nThink ChatGPT, but for video:\n\n☑ Upload an image\n☑ Add an acting video\n☑ Control the camera movement\n☑ Generate & export your final video\n\nThis used to be millions of dollars with CGI.\n\nBut now if you want something, you just act it out.\n\nYou now have a unique opportunity:\n\n1. Record from your living room.\n2. Get Hollywood-level scenes in seconds.\n\nWhat sets Kinetix apart is the 3D control. No other model gets it the way they do. You can move the camera around and achieve real cinematic control.\n\nThey just opened a waitlist.\n\nAnd I partner with their team to select beta testers.\n\nComment \"kinetix\" and  Bonus if you add why you need Kinetix. I have very limited spots.",
