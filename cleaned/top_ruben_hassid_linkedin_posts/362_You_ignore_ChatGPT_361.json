  "text": "You ignore ChatGPT.\n\nBut that's how I stay consistent on Linkedin:\n\n☑ Find your best writing pieces (on Linkedin?).\n☑ Create a document with their copied pasted text.\n☑ Download these texts as TXT. files.\n☑ Now go to ChatGPT and start a new Project.\n☑ Upload all of your TXT. files.\n\nThen I like to start a conversation with this prompt:\n\n\"Tell me about my writing style inside the files I uploaded in this Project. What makes it special?\"\n\nThen once ChatGPT answered (in \"Instant\" mode), I switch it to \"Thinking\" mode + extended thinking.\n\nI then prompt it:\n\n\"Write with this special style you just referred to, and after reading my files again inside this project, write a post about [your topic]\".\n\nTo go deeper, you must leverage your settings.\n\n1. Go to 'personalization'\n2. Find 'custom instructions'. \n3. Select 'enable customization'. \n4. Create a prompt for your custom instructions.\n\nTo copy mine, go to: https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A.\n\n---\n\nSet up your ChatGPT: https://lnkd.in/dqfRVBpC.\n0 to 10,000 followers: https://lnkd.in/dsXdpxPv.\nAI Starter Kit: https://lnkd.in/dFfS3HxJ.\n\nYou learn something?
