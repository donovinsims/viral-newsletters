  "text": "BREAKING: Disney is suing Midjourney for $29M.\n\nAnd it might just be a start:\n\n1. Disney says Midjourney trained their AI illegally.\n2. Over 199 works are part of the lawsuit.\n3. $150,000 per infringed work.\n\n199 x 150,000 = $29,850,000 (minimum)\n\nThis case could change how AI companies use copyrighted material, forever. Here's why:\n\n☑ It will test whether scraping copyrighted art for training is fair use or a payable license. A loss would rewrite the rulebook for every AI lab. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney will force Midjourney to open its training books, exposing exactly which Disney assets were ingested and setting a new transparency benchmark for the industry. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney is also asking for an injunction. If granted, AI models built on unlicensed IP could be frozen or forced to retrain at huge cost. (reuters)\n\n☑ A studio win invites a wave of copy-cat suits from record labels, publishers, and game studios, multiplying potential liability far beyond this $29 M headline. (reuters)\n\nTL;DR: if Midjourney looses, someone could sue OpenAI (and ChatGPT) for training infringement. \n\nNo more ChatGPT?",
