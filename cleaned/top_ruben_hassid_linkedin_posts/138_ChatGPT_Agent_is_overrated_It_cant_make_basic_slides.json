  "text": "ChatGPT Agent is overrated. It can't make basic slides.\n\nHow to best generate slides with AI instead:\n\n1. Go to ChatGPT + o3 model + search.\n2. Prompt it to make a research on your slides.\n3. Add PDFs, excels or anything related if necessary.\n4. Once done, copy & paste this final prompt here:\n\nPrompt: \"Summarize the most important findings in a long brief for my presentation designer. You must include every key data of your research + the outline.\"\n\n5. Paste your results inside Gamma (.app).\n6. For this, you go to \"Create AI\" > \"Paste in text\".\n7. Gamma will generate slides in 1-2 minutes.\n\nYou can edit them. Generate new images. Choose your favorite template for slides. Create charts. \n\nThis is the difference between frontier models (like ChatGPT) and specialized wrappers (like Gamma).\n\nOne is good at everything.\nThe other is the absolute best at one thing.\n\nChoose wisely.\n\nP.S: Help others create slides with AI ♻️.
