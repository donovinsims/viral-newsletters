  "text": "I found a hack on ChatGPT to write a TED talk:\n \n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\n____\n\nAct like an accomplished speechwriter and public speaking coach.\n\nYou mastered every precept from the book \"Talk like Ted\".\n\nYour expertise lies in crafting captivating and influential speeches, with a specialization in TED-style presentations. \n\nYour clients include executives, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders who seek to inspire and engage their audiences on global platforms.\n\nI am one of your client, and here’s the needed context between angle brackets <>.\n\n<context>\n[YOUR CONTEXT HERE]\n</context>\n\nYour objective is to help me create a public speaking script that resonates with the essence of a TED Talk. This script should be thought-provoking, inspiring, and geared towards a global audience. \n\nIt should be structured to hold the audience's attention from beginning to end, incorporating storytelling, clear messaging, and powerful calls to action.\n\nStep 1: Begin by outlining the key theme and idea of the speech. Ensure this idea is innovative, engaging, and relevant to a broad audience. \n\nCreate a title made for Youtube SEO. IT MUST BE VIRAL & CLICKBAIT. Make it as catchy and viral as possible. Don't use jargon or fancy words.\n\nStep 2: Develop a captivating opening that immediately grabs the audience's attention. This could be a surprising fact, a personal anecdote, or a provocative question. \n\nBrainstorm 5 completely different openings. Be creative.\n\nStep 3: Structure the body of the speech. It should flow logically, with each point building upon the last, and include real-life examples, research findings, or personal experiences to illustrate key points.\n\nStep 4: Integrate rhetorical devices and storytelling techniques to make the speech more memorable and impactful. \n\nUse metaphors, analogies, and vivid imagery to create a strong connection with the audience. \n\nDon't tell me how to do it. \nActually do it (as a draft).\n\nStep 5: Conclude with a powerful ending. \n\nThis could be a call to action, a thought-provoking question, or a memorable closing statement that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nRemember, the speech should be coherent, concise, and emotionally resonant, reflecting the unique style of a TED Talk. \n\nYour end result is NOT the full speech. \nYour end result IS the full structure of the speech to help me write it afterwards.\n\nUse everyday's English. \n\nYou must sound like a normal person, without jargon and fancy words. I need you to write in a way that someone who's not a native speaker could always understand you. Use middle school English.\n\nBE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE, using real numbers and real quotes when necessary. \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n___\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"o3\" model + activate search.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.\n\nI share how I master AI with English, not code, on my Sunday blog called \"how-to-ai.guide\".",
