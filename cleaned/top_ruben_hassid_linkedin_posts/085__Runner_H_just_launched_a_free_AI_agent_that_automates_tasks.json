  "text": "𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: Runner H just launched a free AI agent that automates tasks (= what ChatGPT can't do).\n\nHere are 9 automations H does ChatGPT can’t:\n\n☑ Booked a 3-stop Europe trip — found flights, filled payment forms, and emailed the itinerary.\n\n☑ Pulled a Google Doc from Drive, reformatted it, and sent the PDF to a client—all in one prompt.\n\n☑ Ordered usual Instacart groceries, applying the best coupons it spotted on the way.\n\n☑ Applied to 50 PM roles across LinkedIn & Indeed using a résumé and custom cover letters.\n\n☑ Swept Gmail for urgent messages, drafted replies, and queued them for review.\n\n☑ Filled a Google Sheet with live Meta-ad stats, then pushed a recap to the team Slack.\n\n☑ Scheduled a dentist appointment after scanning Google Calendar for openings.\n\n☑ Tracked down the cheapest M2 MacBook that ships to Tel Aviv this week and placed the order.\n\n☑ Paid monthly utility bills, downloaded the receipts, and saved them to Drive.\n\nOverall impression: Runner H feels like an AI intern that can finally scrap (= read the web) like a human.\n\nRunner H runs outside the chat box. It types, navigates, downloads, and gets stuff done.\n\nI feel like it's the future version of AI: a ChatGPT that goes beyond generating text or images. It can DO.\n\nIt's free to try (today) at https://runnerh.com.\n\nI believe it will be soon expensive to try, like Manus AI or OpenAI Operator (both at $200/month).",
