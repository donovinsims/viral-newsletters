  "text": "Bad news: AI is replacing half the consultants.\n\nGood news: ChatGPT isn't even the best at it.\n\n☑ Go to Gamma .app\n☑ Create a new deck with AI, from scratch.\n☑ Or upload your existing PPT directly there.\n\nThis AI combines ChatGPT with custom fine-tuning to create the right slides for your precise needs.\n\nRookies stick to PowerPoint.\nJuniors adopt Canva & ChatGPT.\nProfessionals master Gamma directly.\n\nPS: I can already feel the haters coming.\n\n\"Consultants are not paid for slidedecks.\"\n\nWell, yes & no.\n\n1. \"Consultants spend a significant portion of their time (up to 70%) making slides on PowerPoint.\"\n\nBut also:\n\n2. \"AI will automate roughly 30% of tasks in the consulting sector, particularly impacting junior roles focused on data analysis and report preparation.\"\n\n1. If 70% of the time is spent on presentations...\n2. And most of it is done by juniors...\n\nHalf of the consultants will be replaced by AI.\n\nAnd Gamma proves it with 50 million users.",
