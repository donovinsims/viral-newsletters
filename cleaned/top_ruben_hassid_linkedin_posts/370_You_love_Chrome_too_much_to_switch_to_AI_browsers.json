  "text": "You love Chrome too much to switch to AI browsers.\n\nNow you don't have to (with this free extension):\n\n1. Go to Chrome Web Store. Search \"Claude\".\n2. Click \"Add to Chrome\" (takes 10 seconds).\n3. Click the Claude icon in your toolbar.\n4. Claude sees your page, your tabs.\n5. Agent mode. Claude works and clicks for you.\n6. Open LinkedIn. Go to your feed.\n7. Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/e87Kdy5Z.\n\nMy best use cases:\n\n✦ Research faster. It reads pages & summarizes.\n✦ Write better. Draft and edit in every tab.\n✦ Find ideas. It analyzes feeds & finds patterns.\n✦ Learn anything. Highlight, ask, & get answers.\n\nChatGPT Atlas and Perplexity Comet can do it.\n\nBut Claude extension is:\n\n- Much better at it.\n- Right inside your (existing) Chrome.",
