  "text": "People think I don't (really) use AI for Linkedin.\n\nSo here's a non-edited screen recording of me 1) generating a viral topic 2) a caption 3) an image\n\n☑ This strategy can be replicated in any industry.\n☑ You are still the one controlling the input/output.\n☑ You use AI as a tool - not as a one-hit solution.\n\nAbsolutely no one complains about \"AI-made\".\nBecause there is no such thing as \"AI-made\".\nThere are GOOD posts and BAD posts.\n\nHere's my simple step-by-step process:\n\n☑ Go to the new ChatGPT-5.\n☑ Copy & paste the following prompt:\n\n\"You are an expert at finding topics that go viral on Linkedin. \n\nSearch the web deeply, and find 6x drastically different topics (with a title and a controversial twist attached) about \"TOPIC\". \n\nYour research must be tied to the news: we are in October, 2025.\"\n\n☑ Select your favorite topic from the list.\n☑ Ask for a follow-up prompt to ChatGPT.\n☑ Prompt it to give more details/data about it.\n☑ Once you're happy, copy the optimized topic.\n☑ Paste it on app.easygen.io (the best for Linkedin)\n☑ Generate at very least 3 to 7 different posts.\n☑ Patchwork them into one mega post.\n☑ Edit it. Add your own spice!\n\nHere you have it:\n1. The right topic, selected for virality.\n2. The right caption, generated & edited.\n\nThat's an entire \"AI-made\" post from A to Z.\n\nBut AI was not used to be lazier, but greater.",
