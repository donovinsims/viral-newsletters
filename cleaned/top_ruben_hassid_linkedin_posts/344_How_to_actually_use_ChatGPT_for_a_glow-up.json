Copy & paste the following prompt:\n\n\"Give me tips on how to improve my appearance. I have fair skin, dark brown eyes, and straight brown hair that is currently long and all one length. I usually wear neutral makeup but would like to try something that enhances my features more. Suggest specific hair color, hairstyle, makeup (like eyeshadow, lipstick, and blush tones), and anything else that would help me look more polished or flattering for my features.\"\n\nAnd the results are impressive.\n\nIt's a $20/mo stylist that replies to you, 24/7. \n\nTo master AI without coding, check how-to-ai.guide.",
