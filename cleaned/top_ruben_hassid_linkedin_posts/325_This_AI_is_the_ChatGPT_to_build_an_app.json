  "text": "This AI is the \"ChatGPT to build an app\".\n\nHere’s how to build a full app in one prompt:\n\n1. Go to blink .new. Click “New App”.\n2. Add screenshots or paste a prompt.\n3. Blink builds your app. It auto-hosts on a live URL.\n4. Click around and try to break things on purpose.\n5. Tell Blink what broke. It fixes bugs instantly.\n6. Connect Stripe. Accept payments right away.\n7. Ship your app. \n\nAccess my complete guide for Blink (with prompts):\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dchBme3n.\n\nBlink does everything in one go:\n☑ Full-stack in one prompt (frontend, backend)\n☑ No config, no setup, no waiting\n☑ Native AI blocks: SEO writer, image gen.\n☑ Start from any UI (even a URL), iterate fast\n☑ “Describe the bug” → instant auto-debugging\n☑ Stripe wired end-to-end: idea to checkout.\n☑ Simple credits, predictable spend\n\nWhat about Lovable?\n→ It's the most known vibecoding tool.\n→ But it lacks the full-stack integration Blink has.\n→ Blink is \"prompt-to-product\". It's built for this.\n→ Lovable is more about \"prompt-to-prototype\".\n\nI am recording a Blink vs. Lovable competition. \n\nWildest app idea in the comments gets built live on my next video. I will check the most liked comment.",
