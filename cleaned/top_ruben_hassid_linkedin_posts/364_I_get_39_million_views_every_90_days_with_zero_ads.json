  "text": "I get 39 million views every 90 days, with zero ads.\n\n& this is how I post three times a day:\n\nA good post is one of these three things.\n\n→ 1. Hot news to cover (with a take).\n→ 2. Educational content is shown as a process.\n→ 3. Personal story to inspire others to be different.\n\nI'm personally much more interested in 1 & 2.\n\n✦ perplexity.ai to find trends on 'Discover'.\n✦ grok.com to get tweets (like on the video).\n✦ a GPT for Reddit: https://lnkd.in/dHHUb5h7.\n\nOnce I get the news, I must turn it into:\n\n☑ Quickly understandable data to 'get' the news.\n☑ An angle for my audience to process the news.\n☑ A (hot) take that makes it worth it to read it.\n\nTo extract data, I love using easygen.io (like on my video). I upload an image & it extracts the context.\n\nThen I add my own 1) angle 2) take on it.\n\nThe last step is to 1) generate multiple posts with the same 'Topic' on EasyGen 2) edit the results.\n\nThe whole process takes 5-15 minutes.\n\nIt never 'feels' like AI, because I am here at every step of the journey. When I'm picking the news, writing the angle, editing the take, generating (a lot of) posts, and the final polishing before posting.\n\nAI helps me 1) be consistent, 2) understand what works, 3) rinse & repeat, three times a day.\n\nIt's not AI instead of Humans. It's AI + Humans.",
