For each subreddit, provide: Name, Member count, Activity level (posts per day, comment quality), 3-5 specific problems people discuss, Related subreddits worth checking. Rules: Focus on real conversations, not memes. Prefer engaged communities over large low-signal ones.\"\n\nOnce you have the topic:\n→ find a design (Pinterest) \n→ edit it (Nano Banana) or make one (Canva) \n→ write the caption (Claude).\n\nCopy this Claude prompt to make viral hooks: \n\nPROMPT: \"These are my most viral hooks (2 lines in one hook) on Linkedin, ever.
