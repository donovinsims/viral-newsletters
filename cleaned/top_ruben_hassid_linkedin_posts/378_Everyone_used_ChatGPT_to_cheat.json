  "text": "Everyone used ChatGPT to cheat.\n\nThen everyone used ChatGPT to apologize.\n\nThat's how we use AI (wrong) right now. We ask for “a good answer”… and get the most average one.\n\nAccess my article here: https://lnkd.in/dUtztb6j.\n\nHere’s the way to get answers nobody else gets:\n\n➜ Ask to explore and go beyond\n\nPrompt: “Give me 5 jokes, from the most common to one I’ve never heard.”\n\n- Don’t settle for one answer.\n- This forces AI to give variety, not the safe pick.\n\n➜ Ask to think harder\n\nPrompt: “I already knew this. Go deeper, what’s the 20% you haven’t said yet?”\n\n- Push past the average.\n- This makes AI go over & beyond for less obvious.\n\n➜ Ask to choose sides\n\nPrompt: “Give me 3 strategies - safe, bold, & extreme.”\n\n- Don’t just ask for “good.”\n- This makes AI give new angles & original thinking.\n\nStop prompting for “good.” \nStart prompting for “different.”",
