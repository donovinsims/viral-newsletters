  "text": "I can't believe it.\n\nI just copied a $10 million SaaS without coding:\n\n☑ I don't know how to code.\n☑ I took SCREENSHOTS of an existing app.\n☑ And I simply asked a new AI to... build it for me.\n\n\"Aragon\" is a software making over $10 million a year by turning bad pictures into professional headshots.\n\nI copied their entire app in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThree simple steps for you to copy, too:\n\n1. Go to Blink .new\n2. Upload pictures of the software you want to copy.\n3. Give it a prompt. Here's mine:\n\nPrompt: \"Build a professional AI headshot generator. It should: - have a landing page identical to the one I show you in images attached - shows exact layout and content similar to the images I gave you - allows me to sign in when i click on the sign up button - allow me to upload reference images and select style and background and upload photos in a wizard UX step by step - Use AI to turn reference images into my desired professional headshot. Save the generations data.\"\n\n1. Once you have generated the software, test it.\n2. If there is an error, say it. It will correct it right away.\n3. You can connect your Stripe to receive payments.\n4. I bought a domain: headshots-ai(.)me for you to try.\n\nThe software industry is worth over $200 billion.\n\nAI is replacing it with screenshots & prompts.",
