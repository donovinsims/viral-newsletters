  "text": "You minimize how fast technology compounds.\n\nTake a guess on this question below:\n\n1. How long did we go from domesticating horses to inventing steam machines (= industrial revolution)?\n\n...\n\n5,270 years of innovation. But...\n\n2. ... How long did we go from the steam machine to building 1,000+ km/h deadly military planes?\n\n...\n\n220 years.\n\nSo it took 220 years for humanity to:\n\n☑ Invent the steam machine (Watt, 1769)\n☑ Invent electricity (Edison, 1897)\n☑ Invent planes (Wright, 1903)\n☑ Invent 1,000 km/h planes (1989)\n\nAnd obviously AI isn’t waiting centuries:\n\n☑ Coin the term “AI” (Dartmouth, 1956)\n☑ Beat a world chess champion (Deep Blue, 1997)\n☑ See better than humans (ImageNet victory, 2015)\n☑ Write and code on demand (ChatGPT, 2022)\n☑ Talk, see, and reason in real time (GPT-4o, 2024)\n\nNext stop? 2030.\n\nAnd the curve’s only getting steeper.\n\nPS: To show this to a colleague, you can \"Save\" a post by clicking the top right 3 dots + \"Save\".",
