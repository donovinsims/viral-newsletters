  "text": "I was publicly shamed 8 months ago for using AI.\n\nHere are their claims (aging like milk):\n\n☑ Zero originality\n\"I don't even come up with the topic let alone the content\" \n\n☑ Brag about “mastering AI”\n\"Not only that, but he is mastering the AI … watching people twist themselves in knots over the next couple of decades\"\n\n☑ Chasing vanity metrics with no clear payoff\n \"What do more followers on LinkedIn even get you? Better job applications?\"\n \"I have to assume that in reality, it is primarily an ego/social media validation thing for most\"\n\n☑ Using the buzz as a funnel to sell AI tools/classes\n \"I don't know. They have to pay $20 for AI content so are they making revenue? Dude is probably running online classes on how to become a LI influencer.\"\n \"He is behind the AI tool. So this is all just marketing for him.\" (they just discovered marketing)\n\n___\n\n8 months later?\n☑ 600,000+ people joined the ride\n☑ \"How to AI\" newsletter crossed 100,000+ subs\n\nBut this isn’t about me.\n\nIt’s about anyone afraid to hit publish because someone might whisper \"AI did that.\"\n\nPeople mocked calculators, spell-checkers.\nEven Google at first.\n\nAI is just the latest punching bag. Until it isn't.\n\nHere's the thing:\n→ You don't share AI content to impress cynics.\n→ You share it to find your people.\n\nMine are professionals who understand AI is the most important technology of our lifetime.\n\nThey know mastering it doesn't require code. \nJust plain English.\n\nIf that's you, stop asking permission.\nGo play. Master AI in public.\nMake them uncomfortable.\n\nPS: This post was entirely written by ChatGPT.\n\nHere's the link to prove it: https://lnkd.in/drQ56nWp.\n\nMaster AI with English, not code: how-to-ai.guide.",
