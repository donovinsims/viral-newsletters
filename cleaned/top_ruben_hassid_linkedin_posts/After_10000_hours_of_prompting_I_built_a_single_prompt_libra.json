  "text": "After 10,000+ hours of prompting, I built a single prompt library with every prompt I personally use.\n\nIf you want to move faster, this is your shortcut.\n\nPrompts you’ll find:\n\n✦ Prompt Frameworks (structure, logic, clarity)\n\n✦ Prompt Templates (plug-and-play, fast results)\n\n✦ Marketing Prompts (ads, campaigns, growth)\n\n✦ Writing Prompts (blog, copy, storytelling)\n\n✦ Sales Prompts (outreach, closing, follow-ups)\n\n✦ Business Prompts (strategy, planning, ops)\n\n✦ Education Prompts (lesson plans, study guides)\n\n✦ Image Generation Prompts (art, visuals, branding)\n\nCopy-paste my best prompts into your own stack.\n\nWant (free) access? \n↳ I’ll send the full Notion to everyone reposting ♻️.",
