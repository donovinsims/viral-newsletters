  "text": "This is my favorite ChatGPT prompt hack.\n\nCopy & paste it (after clicking \"...more\"):\n\nPrompt: \"[YOUR ORIGINAL PROMPT]. Answer as a well-informed 1st‑person deep search of the web. Then critique as a 3rd‑person analyst (expert on the matter). Finally, merge both to share your conclusion.\"\n\nHere's an example:\n\nPrompt: \"Should I post on Linkedin using my personal profile or the one from the business I want to grow? Answer as a well-informed 1st‑person deep search of the web. Then critique as a 3rd‑person analyst (expert on the matter). Finally, merge both to share your conclusion.\"\n\nPS: This hack is backed by science.\n\nPerspective‑Transition Prompting: “Answer as 1st‑person; then critique as a 3rd‑person analyst; finally merge both.” Proven to boost depth and reduce bias (Wang et al., 2025).\n\nReshare ♻ to help others prompt ChatGPT better. \n\nPS: I share weekly prompts at Ruben Hassid.\n\nBut my best content is at how-to-ai.guide for free.",
