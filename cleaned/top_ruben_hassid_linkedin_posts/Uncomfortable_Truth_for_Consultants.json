  "text": "Uncomfortable Truth for Consultants:\n\nI replace you for $50 and three AI:\n\nYou need three AI tools to do 80% of the job.\n\n✦ Perplexity to search.\n✦ ChatGPT to reason.\n✦ Gamma to make slides. \n\nHere's exactly how:\n\n1. Perplexity to search.\n\nCopy & paste this prompt:\n\n\"Act like a McKinsey senior consultant. Execute a DMAIC-driven Deep Research workflow—Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control data on [XXX]—structuring findings in MECE-compliant categories into an extensive executive summary.\"\n\nPro tip: Use their \"Research\" model (paid plan).\n\n2. ChatGPT to reason.\n\nCopy & paste this prompt:\n\n\"Act like a McKinsey senior consultant. Findings below:\n [PASTE PERPLEXITY'S ANSWER HERE]. Deduplicate, flag gaps, then distill into 5 MECE insights, 80/20 lens.\n\nFor each insight:\n • Line 1 – ALL-CAPS headline\n • Lines 2-4 – up to three evidence sentences\n • Line 5 – one strategic-implication sentence\nLeave one blank line between insights.\n\n After the insights, add three sections in the same format: UNKNOWN GAPS (3 sentences) QUICK WINS (2 sentences) BOLD HYPOTHESIS (1 sentence)\"\n\n3. Gamma to make slides.\n\n☑ Go to \"Generate with AI\".\n☑ Copy & paste ChatGPT's answer.\n☑ Generate an 8-20 slide deck of your findings.\n\nGamma knows your style. Everything can be edited.\n\nIt even generates the images/charts for you, with AI.\n\nTotal cost: $20 Perplexity + $20 ChatGPT + $10 Gamma. And that's PER MONTH.\n\nHow can junior consultants compete with this?",
