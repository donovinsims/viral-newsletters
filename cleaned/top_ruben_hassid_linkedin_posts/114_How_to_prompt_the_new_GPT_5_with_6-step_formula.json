  "text": "How to prompt the new GPT 5 (with 6-step formula).\n\nSave this P.R.O.M.P.T. framework to master it:\n\n→ Purpose: State the goal, allowed tools, and what “done” means. \nPick minimal or high reasoning effort.\n\n→ Role: Give a persona + clear tool rules. \nRemove contradictions for cleaner reasoning.\n\n→ Order of Action: Ask for a quick plan, then execution, then a short “done” summary. Add “keep going until solved” if needed.\n\n→ Mould the Format: Define style, structure, and length. \nRestate every 3–5 turns for consistency.\n\n→ Personality: Set mood, tone, and verbosity (short / medium / long) to match your audience.\n\n→ Tight Controls: Cap tool calls if needed (e.g., “max 2 lookups”), \nOr insist on full persistence for complex work.\n\nTo read my guide on ChatGPT-5 at how-to-ai.store.",
