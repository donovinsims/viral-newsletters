  "text": "I test the new Chinese Wan 2.5 vs. OpenAI's Sora 2.\n\nSame prompts. 2 different models.  \n\nWan 2.5:\n☑️ One try and it was good.\n☑️ Water, light, and weather feel real.\n☑️ Faces look human, even in close-up.\n☑️ Camera moves are smooth and cinematic.\n\nSora 2:\n☑️ Understands physics.\n☑️ Good light and reflections.\n☑️ Already viral videos made by Sora on socials.\n☑️ But I tried 10+ times to get some shots right...\n\nSora 2 gets all the hype, but Wan is just as good and cheaper (Sora = $0.15/video, Wan = $0.10).",
