  "text": "Most people guess prompting.\n\nBut these prompts fix 80% of your needs:\n\n1. Start with “Let’s think about this differently”\n↳ It stops giving you generic answers.\n↳ You get creative, out-of-the-box ideas.\n\n2. Use “What am I not seeing here?”\n↳ This finds blind spots and hidden assumptions.\n↳ You get a wider, smarter view of your problem.\n\n3. Say “Break this down for me”\n↳ Even for simple things, this works.\n↳ AI explains the steps, the science, and the why.\n\n4. Ask “What would you do in my shoes?”\n↳ AI stops being neutral and gives real opinions.\n↳ You get advice that’s specific and actionable.\n\n5. Use “Here’s what I’m really asking”\n↳ Add this after your main question.\n↳ You get answers that fit your true needs.\n\n6. End with “What else should I know?”\n↳ This is the secret weapon.\n↳ You get a complete answer, not just a quick fix.\n\nThe 7 Sins of Prompting: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W",
