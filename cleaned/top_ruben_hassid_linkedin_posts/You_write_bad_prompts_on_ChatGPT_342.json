  "text": "You write bad prompts on ChatGPT.\n\nYou commit the 7 deadly sins of prompting:\n\n1. No context (\"Analyze this\" with zero background)\n2. Vague instructions (\"Write about marketing\") \n3. Treating it like Google (questions vs prompts)\n4. Asking for everything at once (20 tasks in one)\n5. Not iterating (one prompt and done)\n6. Forgetting to specify format/tone\n7. No examples of what you want\n\nI wrote free prompt engineering guides for you.\n✦ Avoid AI slop: https://lnkd.in/dTbP6irG.\n✦ Be rude to ChatGPT: https://lnkd.in/dsNpzraC.\n✦ 7 Sins of Prompts: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W.\n✦ How people prompt: https://lnkd.in/dGYgcQ_7.\n✦ How to set up ChatGPT: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.\n\nYou learned something?",
