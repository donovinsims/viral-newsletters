  "text": "This AI is the \"ChatGPT to find people\".\n\nAnd I can't believe what just happened:\n\nIt's a public dataset from Bright Data.\n\n1. It's free. You create an account in like 1 min.\n2. You prompt it like ChatGPT, \"Find all [x people]\".\n3. You wait 5-15 min, and you have a complete list. \n4. Export your entire list to an Excel, with URLs.\n\nChatGPT can't. Not even Linkedin?\n\nI have every AI consultant in NYC, SF & London.\n\nThis should take weeks, and $$$$ of dollars.",
