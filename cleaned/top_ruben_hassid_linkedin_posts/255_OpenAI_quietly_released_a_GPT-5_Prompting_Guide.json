  "text": "OpenAI quietly released a GPT-5 Prompting Guide.\n\nHere’s how to get the most out of it:\n\nWhat you skip → can hold you back.\nHow you write → shapes what you get.\nWhat you focus on → tells the model what matters.\n\n1. Use Role + Goal + Guardrails.\n↳ Tell the model who it is, what to achieve, and what to avoid.\n\n2. Layer your context.\n↳ Give background first, rules second, and the task last.\n\n3. Put key instructions last.\n↳ The model heavily weighs the final line.\n\n4. Use a Chain of Verification.\n↳ Think step-by-step, then check each step for errors before moving on.\n\n5. Try Dual-Pass answers.\n↳ Draft first, then improve with a self-check rubric.\n\n6. Force “I don’t know” honesty.\n↳ Prevents confident but wrong answers.\n\n7. Switch perspectives.\n↳ Solve from two angles, then merge the best parts.\n\n8. Control with delimiters.\n↳ Wrap rules or data in ``` or XML tags for clarity.\n\n9. Prime with examples.\n↳ Show 2 good and 1 bad example before asking for output.\n\nTo learn how to make the best out of ChatGPT 5...\nSimply click here: https://lnkd.in/gVx_ZPh3.",
