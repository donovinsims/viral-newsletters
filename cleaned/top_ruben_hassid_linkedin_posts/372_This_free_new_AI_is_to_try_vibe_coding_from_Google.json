  "text": "This free new AI is to try vibe coding (from Google).\n\nA step-by-step guide (click on \"...more\"):\n\n1. Search for \"Stitch by Google\".\n2. It's free & you can sign in with your Gmail.\n3. Select the \"Experimental mode\" (top right).\n\nThen you simply:\n☑ Type your prompt (eg. \"landing page for X\").\n☑ Select \"mobile\" or \"web\" for the format. \n☑ You can upload an image as a template.\n\nFor the last step, you:\n1. Either copy the code of the design.\n2. Or you extract it & copy it for your Figma.\n\nShould I make a \"vibe coding\" guide for non-technical people who want to play with AI?\n\nIf yes, you would rather have me:\nA. Design an entire landing page with AI.\nB. Connect marketing AI agents to my database.\nC. Create a workflow with AI to write content faster.\n\nI wish I could create a poll on Linkedin...\n\nSo instead, I will extract all of your A, B & C comments and create the first guide on it.",
