  "text": "You ignore most AI agents. So do I.\n\nBut this one saves me 20 mins every day.\n\nLet me show you how in <4 minutes:\n\n1. Go to Zapier (sign up for free).\n2. Visit agents. zapier. com.\n3. Click “New Agent” (top right).\n4. Prompt \"Describe your workflow\" like ChatGPT.\n5. Copy-paste my prompt to find & summarize the new AI research papers:\n\nPrompt: \n\n\"Browse to [arxiv website for AI papers]. You must screenshot the website multiple times to collect at least 50 research papers total.\n\nScan through the paper titles and abstracts on the page to identify the 5 best articles. Prioritize articles that help people get better at prompting LLMs. Examples of relevant topics include chain-of-thought prompting techniques, being rude to ChatGPT for better responses, prompt engineering strategies, and practical prompting tips. Avoid articles focused on helping researchers build better LLMs. You successfully teach non-technical users of LLMs to get better at prompt engineering. You do not help researchers.\n\nExtract the arXiv ID (format like arXiv:2511.20627) of the selected 5 papers (out of 50).\n\nNavigate to arxiv [extracted arXiv ID] to access the full paper.\n\nAnalyze the full paper abstract and title content and create a comprehensive summary for each paper. The summary should be a summary analysis highlighting relevance to ChatGPT prompting, including main findings, how it applies to prompting, and practical takeaways for users, and most importantly, the surprising aspect of this paper.\n\nHere is a perfect example of a summary:\n\n[example]\n\nFor each selected paper, collect:\n- Paper Title \n- Summary (summary with ChatGPT prompting relevance, main findings, application to prompting, and practical takeaways)\n- Direct Link (format: link[arXiv ID])\n\nAdd all collected papers to Google Sheets with columns for Paper Title, Summary, and Direct Link. :action[Google Sheets]\n\nSend ONE single Slack message containing all 5 papers in a numbered list format. The message should start with \"Daily AI paper suggestions are ready!\" followed by each paper formatted as:\n\n1. Title: [Paper Name]\narXiv link: [arXiv ID]\nWhy it matters: [summary about the paper and its surprising aspect to prompt LLMs better for non-technical users].\n\nContinue until getting 5.\n\nUse: action[Slack] to send me the message\n\nFinal Goal: Collect exactly 5 relevant AI research papers focused on ChatGPT prompting techniques, save them to Google Sheets, and notify the team via Slack with ONE single message containing all 5 papers in numbered list format with bold field names, indented information.\"\n—\n☑ Make sure you have credits. It costs just a few cents a day. ☑ I get a Slack message and an updated Excel file with the results.\n\n6. Turn your agent on. \n7. Make sure to have credits.\n8. I receive a Slack message + updated Excel.\n\n9. Help others.\n\n✦ Save it for later to create your first AI agent.\n✦ Repost this video ♻️ to help others master AI.\n✦ I partner with Zapier on this sponsored post.",
