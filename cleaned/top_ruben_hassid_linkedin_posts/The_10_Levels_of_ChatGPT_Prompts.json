  "text": "The 10 Levels of ChatGPT Prompts.\n\nLevel 1: “Write it.”\n\nLevel 2: “Rewrite it in my voice.”\n\nLevel 3: “Boil the idea down to its essence.”\n\nLevel 4: “Spot the blind spots.”\n\nLevel 5: “Argue the exact opposite so I see both sides.”\n\nLevel 6: “Rank actions by highest ROI first.”\n\nLevel 7: “Design a repeatable workflow I can hand off.”\n\nLevel 8: “Stress‑test a workflow under scarce time, money, and data.”\n\nLevel 9: “Perform deep research. Find lessons from unrelated fields to discover new angles.”\n\nLevel 10: “Pull from your memory of my style, goals, and history. Remember my personality traits. What is the 20% we should focus on to yield 80% of the results?”\n\nMost people never leave Level 1.\n\nI made a blog on \"How to prompt\": https://lnkd.in/edwXnKRa.\n\nBut here's a quick breakdown on how to instantly write better prompts on ChatGPT, for free:\n\n☑ Go to ChatGPT, on the left menu, click GPTs.\n☑ Search for \"Prompt Maker, Ruben Hassid\".\n☑ Start using it, and share your (bad) prompt.\n\nThe Prompt Maker will rewrite it, but better.\n\n1. This is completely free. \n2. This is right inside ChatGPT.\n3. It has been used 1 million times (and more).\n4. Side note: I don't make money from it, either.\n\nI believe I can help millions of people master the \"How\" of \"AI\" for free, with free tools & free content.\n\nAnd I believe a small portion of these millions of people will want to go deeper, and join us as a paid member of \"How to AI\" at how-to-ai.guide.",
