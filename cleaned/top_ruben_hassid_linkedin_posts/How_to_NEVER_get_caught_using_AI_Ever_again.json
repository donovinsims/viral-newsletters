  "text": "How to NEVER get caught using AI. Ever again.\n\n(save this now - seriously):\n\n1. Go to ChatGPT.\n2. Search “AI Editor Ruben Hassid” GPT.\n3. Paste your AI written text in the chat.\n4. Edit the output in canvas mode.\n5. Or simply use this prompt: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.\n\nI train it to ban the typical ChatGPT writing style.\n\nTo know how to use it, check my (free) article here:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.\n\nBy the way, that's how you can tell this is AI-written:\n\n1. Stop padding sentences with empty filler phrases.\n2. Ban obvious AI vocabulary immediately.\n3. Vary your pacing. Don't write like a metronome.\n4. Kill the meta-commentary; just say the thing.\n5. Write as you speak, using 'I' and 'you'.\n6. Delete 'In conclusion.'\n7. Use formatting like salt; don’t look like a template.\n8. Take a stance. Stop hedging.\n9. Ditch the overused 'Rule of Three.'\n10. Be concrete. Specific writing sounds human.\n\nPeople struggle to write correctly with AI.\n\nYou want to help your network?",
