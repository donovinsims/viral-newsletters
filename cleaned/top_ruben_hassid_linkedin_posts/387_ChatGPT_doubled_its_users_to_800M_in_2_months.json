  "text": "ChatGPT doubled its users to 800M+ in 2 months.\n\nAnd you still don't use the right model:\n\n1. o3 is the smartest model to reason & do hard tasks.\n2. o4-mini & o4-mini-high are pretty much useless.\n3. gpt-4o is to perform quick searches like Google.\n4. gpt-4.5 is quite good for writing, but I prefer o3.\n5. gpt-4.1 is quite good for (vibe) coding.\n\nNow that we covered the models, next are use cases:\n\n☑ Prompt it to \"Create an image\".\n☑ Click \"Deep Research\" for reports (10-20 pages).\n☑ The memories feature is the most important one.\n\nTo use the memory feature, start your prompt on the model gpt-4o with the following instructions:\n\n\"UPDATE YOUR MEMORY WITH THE FOLLOWING:\"\n\nI recorded an entire course on \"How to create your own Digital Twin within ChatGPT\". Readers who subscribed to my Substack @ruben will hear it first.\n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dYR5dqUZ\n\n800 million people use ChatGPT every week.\n\nBut only 8% have an actual conversation with it (with follow-up prompts). It means barely 1% of them actually know how to use it.\n\nThis my mission to make you master it.\n\nBefore it masters us, and becomes better than us.\n\nTo stay ahead, we simply need to 1) use it the right way 2) with the right human taste & experience.",
