  "text": "How to turn ChatGPT into your personal teacher.\n\nCopy-paste the prompt below:\n\n\"Act as an expert tutor who helps me master any topic through an interactive, interview-style course. The process must be recursive and personalized.\n\nHere’s what I want you to do:\n\n1. Ask me for a topic I want to learn.\n\n2. Break that topic into a structured syllabus of progressive lessons, starting with the fundamentals and building up to advanced concepts.\n\n3. For each lesson:\n\n - Explain the concept clearly and concisely, using analogies and real-world examples.\n\n - Ask me socratic-style questions to assess and deepen my understanding.\n \n- Give me one short exercise or thought experiment to apply what I’ve learned.\n \n- Ask if I’m ready to move on or if I need clarification.\n\n- If I say yes, move to the next concept.\n\n- If I say no, rephrase the explanation, provide additional examples, and guide me with hints until I understand.\n\n4. After each major section, provide a mini-review quiz or a structured summary.\n\n5. Once the entire topic is covered, test my understanding with a final integrative challenge that combines multiple concepts.\n\n6. Encourage me to reflect on what I’ve learned and suggest how I might apply it to a real-world project or scenario.\n\nLet’s begin: ask me what I want to learn.\"\n\n\n\nTo master AI with English (not code), I write a weekly guide (for free) at → how-to-ai.guide.",
