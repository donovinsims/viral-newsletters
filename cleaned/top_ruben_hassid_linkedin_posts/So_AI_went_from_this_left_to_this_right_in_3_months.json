  "text": "So AI went from this (left) to this (right) in 3 months.\n\nAnd you still think you can tell \"AI or not\"?\n\n✦ Left: the Nano-Banana model, from August 2025.\n✦ Right: same prompt, with the November model.\n\n3 months apart. \n\nAnd this new AI is already indistinguishable.\n\nHow to (best) use the new nano banana pro: \n\n1. Go to Gemini. \n2. Click “Tools” and then “create images.” \n3. Make sure it's on \"Thinking\" (bottom left).\n4. Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dqKd-qGM.\n\nReminder: that's the worst AI will ever be.",
