  "text": "You're prompting ChatGPT-5.2 like it's ChatGPT-4.\n\nHere are 5 new prompt rules for GPT-5.2:\n\n1. Purpose: Say what NOT to do\nGPT-5.2 gives you more than you asked for.\nExtra code. Bonus ideas. Random additions.\n\nFix: \"Do exactly what I ask. No extras. No embellishments.\"\n\n2. Role: Add a \"keep it simple\" rule\nGive it a job title, but don't confuse it.\nMixed instructions mess it up.\n\nFix: \"You are [expert]. If something is unclear, go with the simpler choice.\"\n\n3. Instructions: Stop the play-by-play\nGPT 5.2 knows what do if it has the right goal.\nFocus on the goal more than the steps.\n\nFix: \"Focus on the goal completion. I will consider it a success once we [target] for [audience].\"\n\n4. Manner: Give Exact Lengths\nWords like \"short\" or \"brief\" are too vague.\nBe specific. Use numbers.\n\nFix: \"3-6 sentences\" or \"max 5 bullets\" or \"2 sentences for yes/no.\"\n\n5. Effort: The Default Changed\nThinking mode is now \"none\" by default.\n\nFix: Always use \"Thinking mode\". Extended is even better. Understand ChatGPT is better with patience.\n\n6. I already tested what works with GPT-5.2.\nSo you don't have to.\n\nCopy my prompts: https://lnkd.in/dkcDCGb5.\n\n__\n\nChatGPT-5.2 is smarter but does too much.\n\nYour job is no longer to push it. It's to hold it back.",
