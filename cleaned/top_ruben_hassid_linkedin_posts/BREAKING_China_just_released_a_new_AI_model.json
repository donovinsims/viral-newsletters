  "text": "BREAKING: China just released a new AI model.\n\nAnd no. This is NOT about DeepSeek:\n\nKimi is another ChatGPT moment for China.\n\n☑ +24 million users (!!).\n☑ Completely free to use on kimi(.)com.\n☑ Open-source. Cheap API. State-of-the-art.\n\nMy favorite use case is their \"Researcher\" tool.\n\n1. Go to kimi(.)com & click the \"Researcher\" button.\n2. Ask for a detailed report, like my video:\n\nPrompt: \"Create a full article about the band 'Coldplay', from before their start until the super viral CEO/affair scandal. Add the right typos & images that fit Coldplay's branding.\"\n\nKimi will ask questions. I said, \"Include everything.\"\n\nAnd the results are fascinating:\n→ It's quite long to generate (30 min), but unmatched.\n→ An entire blog, with images & over 170 sources.\n→ A shareable link you can send to your team.\n\nUS companies battle for closed-source AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini...). But China is building at neck-breaking speed the best open-source AI.\n\nChinese competition is so fierce they simply have to be the best... at the cheapest price... as fast as possible.\n\nDon't underestimate Chinese AI models. Ever.",
