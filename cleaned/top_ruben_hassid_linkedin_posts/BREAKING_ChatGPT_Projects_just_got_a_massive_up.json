  "text": "BREAKING: ChatGPT Projects just got a massive up.\n\nIt will change how I use ChatGPT:\n\n1. Open any chat, hit “Move to project” or click “New Project.”\n\n2. Drop in PDFs, spreadsheets, images, and set project instructions (e.g., “Act like my CFO”).\n\n3. Hit “Deep Research” for an instant, cited report that merges your files, chat history, and live web.\n\n4. Tap the mic in any project & talk instead of type.\n\nWhat shipped today (June 12th, 2025)\n\n☑ Deep Research inside projects\n☑ Voice Mode for projects\n☑ Project-scoped memory (Plus/Pro)\n☑ Share-a-single-chat links\n☑ Mobile file uploads + model picker\n☑ One-click project creation from any chat\n\nOpenAI wants ChatGPT to be the everything app.\n\nIt's going after...\n→ Lightweight knowledge bases & wikis\n→ Stand-alone research assistants / citation tools\n→ Solo project-management and note apps\n\nIn the last 10 days, OpenAI went on a streak:\n\n1. June 4: Drive & GitHub connectors unlocked for Deep Research.\n\n2. June 7: Voice Mode got a natural-sounding upgrade.\n\n3. June 10: o3-pro launched—OpenAI’s best reasoning model yet. Maybe ever?\n\n4. June 12: Projects received research, voice, memory, sharing, and mobile boosts (today).\n\nChatGPT’s pace of innovation is slightly scary.",
