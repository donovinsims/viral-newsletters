  "text": "You write bad prompts on ChatGPT.\n\nHere's how to fix it:\n\n1. Ask ChatGPT to ask you questions.\n2. Use a step-by-step format. \n3. Be clear & precise.\n\nIt's all about \"context engineering\" more than \"prompt engineering\". I wrote a free blog about it how to master it: https://lnkd.in/dDfJK_Mp.\n\n☑ Don't use AI to confirm what you already think.\n☑ Use AI to explore what you haven't considered. \n\nPS: I share how I master AI with words, not code, on my blog \"how-to-ai.guide\".
