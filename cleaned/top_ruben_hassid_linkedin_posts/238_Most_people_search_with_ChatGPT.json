  "text": "Most people search with ChatGPT. \n\nBut ChatGPT is not the best for search. \n\nThere are better AI search engines (October 2025). \n\nHere’s what you need to know: \n\n1 - Perplexity \nFast, clear, and always gives sources. \nBest for research and up-to-date info. \n\n2 - Grok \nMade by xAI. Has access to Twitter (X) data. \nGreat for trending topics and real-time news. \n\n3 - DeepSeek \nStrong at technical & academic searches. \nImpressive for code and math. \n\n4 - Claude (Sonnet 4.5)\nGood for summaries and long answers. \nHandles context better than most. \n\n5 - Gemini \nBest for visual tasks and Google data.\nEdits images, understands context.\n\n6 - Kimi \nChina’s least biased AI. Good for sensitive topics. \nGives balanced, neutral answers.\n\n7 - ChatGPT \nStill strong for creative writing & brainstorming. \nNot the best for live search. Lacks real-time data. \n\ntl;dr: Perplexity is the best AI for search.\n\nI wrote a (free) blog on How to search with AI.\n\nDon't miss it at https://lnkd.in/gPD53iDj.",
