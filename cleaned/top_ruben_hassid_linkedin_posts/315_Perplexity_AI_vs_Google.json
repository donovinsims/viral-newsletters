  "text": "Perplexity AI vs. Google\n\n(hint: this is why Google is dying)\n\n☑ Left: I ask Google for the best Parisian tours.\n☑ Right: I ask Perplexity for the same question.\n\nAnd the results are not even comparable.\n\n↳ Google wants you to click on 4x different sponsored links. It's a $40bn a year industry.\n\n↳ Perplexity gives you the straight answer. No clicking, no scrolling. Everything in 2-5 seconds.\n\nI ran similar tests with ChatGPT-o3 + search, Claude + search, or even Gemini (from Google itself).\n\nAnd the market knows it: Alphabet (= Google) is down 5% since last year. No sign of recovery.\n\nPerplexity recently raised $500 million at a $14 billion valuation. Rumors said Apple tried to buy it.\n\n--- How to master search in the age of AI ---\n\nHere's my go-to list of guides:\n\n1. How to use o3: https://lnkd.in/ddm7AWJi\n2.
