  "text": "I stop using ChatGPT (because of Claude).\n\nBut you must set it up this (exact) way:\n\n1. Go to claude.ai.\n2. Choose \"Opus 4.5\" + Extended thinking.\n3. Go to \"Projects\" and add your favorite texts.\n4. Customize its instructions to match your style.\n5. Step-by-step here: https://lnkd.in/e87Kdy5Z.\n\nI am writing a newsletter to 200,000+ readers. \nAnd Claude is my biggest help in writing like me.\n\nI just recorded a video on how I write with Claude right here (it's free): https://lnkd.in/e87Kdy5Z.\n\nLately, people are understanding AI is everywhere, and the \"AI touch\" in writing style is super annoying.\n\nYou must avoid sounding like an AI.\n\nI wrote a guide here: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5.\n\nBut here's my guide to sound like you, with Claude:\n\n1. Click on the \"+\" (bottom left of the chat).\n2. Click on \"Use style\" > \"Create & edit styles\".\n3. Click on the dark \"Create custom style\" button.\n4. Add a writing example, or simply prompt your style.\n\nYou now have (1) a project, set up (2) your own style.\n\nCombine the two, and you will always sound like you.\n\nBecause who cares if you're using AI?\n↳ We want your opinion, with your own words. \n\nAI or not.",
