  "text": "Your LinkedIn is your 2025 business card.\n\nBut you fail at making it attractive:\n\nEveryone needs a proper Linkedin...\n\n✦ ... to get funding for your startup.\n✦ ... to sell your services/products.\n✦ ... to hire new employees.\n\nBut first, you need an attractive profile:\n\n1. Profile Picture\n☑ Smile, zoomed-in.\n☑ Simple, branded background.\n☑ 1000x1000 dimensions for HD.\n\n2. Banner\n☑ One message.\n☑ Simple, branded color.\n☑ Don't make it too cluttered.\n\n3. Featured Section\n☑ Link your website here.\n☑ No description for zero-click.\n☑ The most important part of your profile.\n\n4. About section\n☑ Leave it blank to see the featured section.\n☑ More views on featured section = more clicks.\n\n5. Custom Link\n☑ Pay for Linkedin Premium.\n☑ Add a \"View my website\" under your name.\n\n6. Experience\n☑ This is where you talk about yourself.\n☑ AI like ChatGPT reads this to know you.\n☑ So be extremely extensive there. Write a lot.\n\n7. Skills\n☑ Use the max. 50 skills for visibility.\n\nI wrote a guide to go from 0 to 10,000 followers.\n\nTo access it, visit this website → how-to-lkdn.ai",
