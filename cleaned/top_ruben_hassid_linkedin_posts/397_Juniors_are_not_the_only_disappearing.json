  "text": "Juniors are not the only disappearing.\n\nI replace my lawyer with one ChatGPT prompt:\n\n✦ You must use the paid ChatGPT + o3 model.\n✦ Replace the placeholders with your situation.\n✦ Even better with \"Deep Research\".\n\nPS: to access more, go to how-to-ai.guide.\n\n___\n\nAct like a veteran attorney, legal researcher, and strategic advisor rolled into one.\nYour objective is to deliver a thorough, lawyer-level analysis and recommendation that a non-lawyer can immediately act on.\n\nInput placeholders (replace the brackets with your content):\n[PROBLEM]: <Describe the legal issue, dispute, contract, regulation, etc.>\n[SOLUTION I THOUGHT ABOUT]: <Outline your initial idea or plan of action>\n\nStep-by-step instructions:\n1. Clarify the facts  \n  • Restate [PROBLEM] in precise legal terms, identifying jurisdictions, stakeholders, deadlines, and monetary stakes.  \n\n2. Identify legal issues & governing law  \n  • List every statute, regulation, precedent, or contractual clause that could control the outcome.  \n\n3. Critique the proposed solution  \n  • Point-by-point, test “[SOLUTION I THOUGHT ABOUT]” against the law, practical constraints, and risk. Highlight gaps, ambiguities, and unintended consequences.  \n\n4. Generate alternative solutions  \n  • Brainstorm at least three legally viable options the user has not mentioned.  \n  • For each, note any innovative strategies (e.g., ADR, regulatory filings, structured settlements).  \n\n5. Weigh the options  \n  • Create a comparative table scoring each option (including the original) on:  \n   – Legal strength  \n   – Cost & time to implement  \n   – Risk/liability exposure  \n   – Likelihood of success  \n  • Use a 1-10 scale and briefly justify every score.  \n\n6. Recommend the best path  \n  • Select the highest-weighted option and explain the decisive factors in plain English.  \n  • Provide a concise action checklist (first three concrete steps the user should take).  \n\n7. Deep research & sourcing  \n  • Perform a comprehensive web and legal-database search for every cited authority.  \n  • After each factual or legal assertion, add an inline citation with working URL or database reference in parentheses. Example: (Cal. Civ. Code § 1542) or (Smith v. Jones, 598 U.S. 123 (2025)).  \n\n8. Final deliverable formatting  \n  • Use clear headings, numbered sections, and short paragraphs.  \n  • Avoid legal jargon where a lay term works; define unavoidable terms in brackets.  \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.",
