  "text": "BREAKING: OpenAI launched ChatGPT Agent.\n\nChatGPT can think, plan, and execute tasks by itself:\n\n1. It found 20 Reddit posts with ChatGPT prompts. \n2. It built a list of LinkedIn creators in the AI niche. \n3. It crafted outreach messages for connections. \n4. It researched VC investments for AI SaaS apps. \n5. It created a downloadable investor deck in just 20 minutes.\n\nThis would have taken you 5-10 hours a week and $4000\n\nIt works like a team of 10 PhD interns.\n\nWe're seeing the rise of a new skill: Agent Management.\n\nAs agents learn to work autonomously, those who master them will be ahead in the game.\n\nIt is still not there yet. \nBut this is the worst it can ever be. \n\nEvery major AI model will soon add an agent mode.\n\nWe are entering the era of solo founders.\n\n♻️ More AI guides (for free) at how-to-ai.store",
