  "text": "You will (most likely) fall in love with AI:\n\n☑ 26% of adults admit they flirted with an AI.\n\n☑ 40% say they would consider dating an AI partner.\n\n☑ 25% of young US adults (18-40) believe AI partners could replace real-life romance.\n\n☑ 15% of Gen Z worry a human partner will prefer an AI bot over them.\n\nAre we already living in the movie 'Her'?\n\n___\n\nMy take on it: humanity is declining. Birth rates are collapsing. We lack a positive vision of the future. An exciting world to live in.",
