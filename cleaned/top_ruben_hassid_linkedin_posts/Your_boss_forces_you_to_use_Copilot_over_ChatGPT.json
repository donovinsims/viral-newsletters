  "text": "Your boss forces you to use Copilot over ChatGPT.\n\nSend your boss this side-by-side comparison:\n\n✦ Quick answer.\n\nChatGPT is the clear winner.\n\n☑ Longer answer, more detailed.\n☑ More sources, with articles' images.\n☑ Just as fast, but way more articulated.\n\n✦ Deep answer.\n\nChatGPT is simply smarter.\n\n☑ It reasons deeper.\n☑ It gave me a much better analysis.\n☑ It surprised me in its thinking to (actually) help.\n\n✦ Research.\n\nChatGPT is not just better, but miles ahead.\n\n☑ Much, much longer research.\n☑ The depth of the analysis is unmatched.\n☑ It feels like both features aren't even the same.\n\nUsing Copilot instead of ChatGPT in 2025 is like driving a horse cart on a highway full of cars.\n\nStay ahead of the AI curve.
