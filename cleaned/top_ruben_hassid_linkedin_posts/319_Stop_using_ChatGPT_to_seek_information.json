  "text": "Stop using ChatGPT to seek information.\n\nThis is a much better combo:\n\n1. Use Perplexity Pro.\n2. Make sure to use \"Research\".\n3. Copy and paste this prompt below:\n\n“I need [specific fact/criteria] about [subject] as of [date/today/timeframe]. Give the answer, key caveats, and what to double-check.”\n\nFor example, I love using this for viral topics:\n\n“I need the top 3 viral AI startup stories as of today. Give the answer, key caveats (such as disputed details or unconfirmed reports), and what to double-check before posting.”\n\nPerplexity will search real-time news, link direct sources, and flag possible issues (like if a stat is outdated or a report comes from a single source).\n\n---\n\nI wrote an entire blog on how to start with AI. \n\nDon't miss it at https://lnkd.in/d2BQW-w6.",
