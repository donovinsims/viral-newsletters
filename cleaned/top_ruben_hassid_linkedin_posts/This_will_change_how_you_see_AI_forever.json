  "text": "This will change how you see AI forever. \n\nChatGPT gets most of its facts from... Reddit.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nA new study from Semrush in June 2025 shows where AI gets its facts.\n\n✦ Reddit makes up 40.1% of all citations.\n✦ Wikipedia is next at 26.3%.\n✦ Youtube and Google follow close behind.\n\nWhen you ask ChatGPT for an answer, you’re getting a mix of internet debates, community posts, and crowd-sourced knowledge.\n\nSo people on Reddit & their debate shapes ChatGPT, which then shapes the rest? Sounds risky.",
