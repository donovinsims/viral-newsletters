  "text": "You ignore Reddit.\n\nBut that's how I find trends before you:\n\n☑ Go to Reddit. Type your niche in the search bar.\n☑ Filter by \"Relevant\" → \"Top\" of the week/month.\n☑ Find frustrations, limitations, and people's needs.\n\n→ Google is for indexing.\n→ ChatGPT is for doing a task.\n→ Reddit is to find people's needs.\n→ Perplexity is to get the right answer.\n→ EasyGen is to write your Linkedin post.\n\nUse the right tool, the right way.",
