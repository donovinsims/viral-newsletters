  "text": "Your ChatGPT prompt is stuck at level 3.\n\nBut the magic happens at level 5:\n\n✦ The right model (thinking).\n✦ The right context (who are you?)\n✦ The right role (who should answer?)\n✦ The right hacks (/search + \"think deeply).\n✦ The right ask (start with ideas, not output).\n\nHere's the prompt template for a level 5:\n\n(make sure to use GPT-5 thinking model, top left)\n\n___\n\n/search Think deeply.\n\nAct as [role needed]. Use our chat history & my memories to [task] about [what]. [Additional context], but I feel [problem]. Before [task that I think I want], how could we focus on the 20% that yields 80% of the results? Ask me the right questions to determine how to [solve problem].\n\n___\n\nI wrote a guide on prompt engineering, and also how to start with AI at https://lnkd.in/d2BQW-w6.\n\nYou must be a paid member of my Substack (it's $200 per year). You will get access to my member-only chat (like a Slack), and all of my previous courses, videos & how-to-ai guides.",
