  "text": "BREAKING: Stanford just surveyed 1,500 workers & AI experts about which jobs AI will actually replace.\n\nTurns out, we've been building AI for all the WRONG jobs. Here's what they discovered:\n\n(hint: the \"AI takeover\" is happening backwards)\n\n→ Workers don't want full automation. They want partnership.\n\n46.1% of tasks got positive automation ratings, but here's the kicker: workers prefer \"H3 equal partnership\" with AI over full replacement.\n\n→ Scientists divided AI adoption into 4 zones based on worker desire vs. technical capability.\n\n41% of startup investments are going to the WRONG zones, i.e. areas workers don't want automated or that have low capability.\n\n→ High-paying \"analyzing information\" jobs are becoming less valuable.\n\n\"Interpersonal communication\" skills are skyrocketing in importance. It's the complete opposite of what every expert predicted.\n\n→ Creative workers drew a hard line in the sand.\n\nOnly 17% of creative tasks got positive automation ratings. Workers are saying: \"automate my boring stuff, not my creative work.\"\n\nThe message is crystal clear, but tech isn't listening.\n\n→ 45.2% of occupations want H3 partnership over full automation.\n\nThis reveals a massive opportunity in human-AI collaboration that everyone's ignoring. The future is teamwork, not replacement.\n\n→ The wage reversal is already happening.\n\nSkills ranked by current wages vs. future human agency needs show a massive shift:\n\n• \"Analyzing data\" dropping down\n• \"Training others\" rising up\n• \"Interpersonal skills\" becoming premium\n\n→ In audio interviews, Stanford found that when workers describe their ideal AI future, 23% want \"role-based support\", i.e. AI that acts like a specialized teammate, not a replacement.\n\n\"Set up my AI assistant,\" not \"replace me with AI.\"\n\n→ Here's what workers actually said they want:\n\n• \"Automate the task so I can focus on high-value work\" - 69.38%\n• \"Handle the repetitive stuff\" - 46.6%\n• \"Reduce stress and mental drain\" - 25.5%\n\nFreedom to do meaningful work, not unemployment.\n\n→ Notion also surveyed 1,000 decision-makers and hit the same nerve: embed AI, don’t replace humans. 57 % pick new tools for team productivity, only 44 % because the label says “AI.”\n\n→ Half already claw back an extra hour every week thanks to AI Meeting Notes and Enterprise Search.\n\n→ The three walls blocking widespread AI adoption: fragmented workflows, ballooning costs, and mistrust in hallucinating outputs.\n\n→ Translation: winners weave AI into existing workflows, automate grunt work, and let humans steer creativity. The future is H3 partnership, not H4 replacement.\n\nAccess the full Notion report for free at this link: https://lnkd.in/epKZaQW6\n\nPS: I'm a #NotionPartner. I love Notion.",
