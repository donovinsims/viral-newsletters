  "text": "After 1,000+ hours of testing & experimenting,\nmy list of AI for videos, from best to worst:\n\n1. Google Veo 3 - https://gemini.google.com/\n- Best model to follow your prompt instructions.\n\n2. Kinetix - https://www.kinetix.tech/\n- The best model to control the camera in 3D\n\n3. Kling 2.5: https://lnkd.in/eB5fjyhd. \n- The most creative model for image-to-video.\n\n4. Hailuo - https://hailuoai.video/\n- Good prompt adherence, physics, consistency.\n\n5. Pixverse: https://lnkd.in/gyJscdqN\n- Good attention to detail and gets physics right. \n\n6. Midjourney - midjourney.com \n- The best model to make image (not video).\n\n7. Luma AI - https://lumalabs.ai/\n- They released 'Ray-3', but I couldn’t make it work. \n\n8. Moonvalley - https://lnkd.in/g5QESH7W\n- A new player, but still not convincing.\n\n9. OpenAI Sora - https://sora.chatgpt.com/ \n- The hype was real. But it did not live up to it. \n\nI made a blog where I test all of them. Read the full breakdown here: https://lnkd.in/d4UQkppd",
