  "text": "How I turn any job description into a perfect resume + cover letter, using AI. \n\nStep #1. Copy the job description.\n\nGo to Linkedin. Copy the job description.\n\nThat's almost the hardest step aha.\n\nStep #2. Go to ChatGPT.\n\nCopy-paste my monstrous prompt.\n\nIt's in my comment section. \n\nStep #3. Copy-paste the job description.\n\nOnce ChatGPT understood its mission...\n\n...you feed it the whole job description.\n\nIt will create:\n→ A match map between your CV and the job.\n→ A draft resume to fill in.\n→ CV tips to fit the role.\n→ A custom cover letter.\n\nBonus #. Add the company's info.\n\nOpen another ChatGPT window.\n\nStart your prompt like this:\n\n\"I would like to apply for a job position. Here's my cover letter.\"\n\nThen copy paste your AI cover letter.\n\nAnd finish the prompt with this:\n\n\"I want you to visit their website to get specific details to add to my cover letter.\"\n\nChatGPT will fetch their whole website to make your cover letter...even better.\n\n \n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more.",
