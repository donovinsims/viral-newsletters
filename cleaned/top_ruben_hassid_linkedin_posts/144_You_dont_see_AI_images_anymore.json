  "text": "You don't see AI images anymore.\n\nBecause you can't see them anymore:\n\n✦ Left: it's the original photo.\n✦ Right: edited by the new Google \"nano-banana\".\n\nThis is it. It's impossible to tell the difference.\n\nNo more weird hands. No more missing fingers. No more funny-looking & trippy backgrounds.\n\nThere is no going back. I won't ever believe any image I see. I will assume it's AI until proven wrong.",
