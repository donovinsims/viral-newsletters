  "text": "RIP Linkedin.\n\nThis AI copied Linkedin in seconds:\n\nAnd no. This is not Lovable, but Blink.\n\nIt took me 10 minutes to 1) prompt 2) create 3) host on a domain 4) and make an entire Linkedin usable.\n\nHere's the step-by-step (from the video):\n\n1. Go to Blink .new\n2. Upload pictures of the software you want to copy.\n3. Or give it a prompt. Here's mine from the video:\n\nPrompt: \"Lets make a functional LinkedIn clone. User can sign up, create profile, see posts from others, make comments and replies, update their profile. Pixel perfect LinkedIn branding.\"\n\n4. Once you have generated the software, test it.\n5. If there is an error, say it. It will correct it fast.\n6. You can connect your Stripe to receive payments.\n7. It's hosted on a domain, your own website to visit.\n\nMicrosoft acquired Linkedin for $26 billion.\nAnd AI is copying it with screenshots & prompts.\n\nPS: No, you don't have the right to copy Linkedin.\nThe point is to showcase how advanced AI is.",
