  "text": "Stop paying for 20+ AI subscriptions for videos.\n\nThis AI has them all under one tool:\n\nGenspark is built to be the \"one tool for all\".\n\n✦ It is NOT \"another AI video that tries to be good.\"\n✦ It is a tool hosting the best, like Veo-3 or Sora-2.\n✦ But also niche ones like Kling, Runway, Minimax...\n\nBecause the problem is...\n↳ You want to test every AI out there.\n↳ But they all require an individual subscription.\n↳ And they keep on updating their latest models.  \n\nGenspark is just one subscription, super useful for videos and image generation to cover every model.\n\nThat's why I partner with them. Because I don't want to deal with every API of every company.\n\nYou pay one tool to try them all. A simpler AI stack.",
