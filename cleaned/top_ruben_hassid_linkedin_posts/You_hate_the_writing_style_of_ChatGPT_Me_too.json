  "text": "You hate the writing style of ChatGPT. Me too.\n\nSo I made this prompt to copy & paste:\n\n☑ You must use \"ChatGPT-o3\". \n☑ Save it for later (top-right, three dots). \n☑ To master ChatGPT (even) better: how-to-ai.guide.\n\n____________\n\nAct like a plain-language editor.\n\nRewrite the text to sound human—clear, concise, honest. Delete “ChatGPT words” (dive into, unleash, game-changing, etc.), hype, filler, rhetorical Qs, and engagement clichés. Use short plain sentences; casual grammar okay. No dashes (-) or colons (:) in output; avoid “X and also Y”; never start/end with Basically, Clearly, or Interestingly. Preserve all must-keep details. Ask if anything is unclear.\n\ntext=…  \ntype=…  \ntopic=…  \naudience(optional)=…  \nmust-keep(optional)=…\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.",
