  "text": "I just canceled my Perplexity subscription.\n\nHere's how to best use o3 instead:\n\nStep 1: go to chat .com (it's chatgpt).\nStep 2: choose the \"o3\" model, their best to date.\nStep 3: click on the search icon to search the web.\n\nI compared o3 vs. perplexity on this entire video.\n\nSo why is ChatGPT better than Perplexity:\n\n☑ It can reason AND search the web. Like an agent.\n☑ It's slower, but it knows my entire history.\n☑ Its visual capacity is beyond magical.\n\nNo need for multiple subscriptions anymore.\n\nSo Perplexity must do better. Fast.",
