  "text": "10 boring tasks AI does faster than you ever could. \n\nIt make you feel dumb for doing them manually: \n\n1. gamma.app (for ugly slides)\n→ The PowerPoint killer. \n→ Unmatched design taste. Done in 2 minutes.\n\n2. canva.com (for no designer)\n→ The most famous non-designer design tool. \n→ AI features getting better.\n\n3. claude.ai (for blank page)\n→ The best ChatGPT alternative for writing. \n→ Feels human. Feels different.\n\n4. blink.new (for no coding)\n→ Vibecoding for people who don't code. \n→ Prompt it like ChatGPT, build apps.\n\n5. granola.ai (for meeting notes)\n→ The best AI notetaker. Simple. \n→ And doesn't connect to the call (finally).\n\n6. opus.pro (for replacing expensive editor)\n→ Upload a YouTube link, get clips. \n→ Create 20-50 TikToks from one video.\n\n7. notebooklm.google.com (for learning)\n→ Upload courses. Get podcasts & quizzes.\n→ Train on your sources. Can take 50 sources.\n\n8. gemini.google.com (for no photo/video editor)\n→ Nano-Banana-Pro for images. \n→ Veo-3 for videos. Both are insane.\n\n9. wispr.ai (for yapping out ideas in words)\n→ Write with your voice. Crazy fast. \n→ Keeps learning from your edits.\n\n10. grok.com (for fast & correct news)\n→ The best way to search Twitter. \n→ That alone makes it worth it.\n\nYou're not slow. \nYou're just doing stuff AI should be doing.\n\nPick one. Try it today.",
