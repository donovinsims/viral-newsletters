  "text": "Most LinkedIn profiles are boring.\n\nStand out & optimize yours with these 7 tips:\n\nYour profile is your online brand. Make it shine.\n\n1. Colors & Fonts:\n↳ Choose the right colors and fonts. \nUse this free GPT tool to find yours: https://lnkd.in/dps7m-HC \n\n2. Profile Picture: \n↳ Use an HD 1080 x 1080 photo. Make it smiley with a clear background.\nTry this AI tool: Flux, to generate your professional headshot: https://lnkd.in/gkSwZhaE.\n\n3. Banner: \n↳ Get an HD 1584 x 396 px banner that says one thing. \nIf you pay for LinkedIn, consider a slideshow. It grabs attention.\n\n4. Headline: \n↳ Make your headline your mission, with a twist. \nMy mission: “How to create content with AI.” \nMy headline: “Write your first post on LinkedIn.” \nKeep it clear.\n\n5. Featured Section: \n↳ Include one link, big text, and no description. \nAvoid putting your best posts here. \nIt’s better to have fewer clicks for more conversions.\n\n6. About Section: \n↳ I don’t have one. \nIt’s faster for people to see my featured section. \nShare who you are in your experience section instead.\n\n7. Experience Section: \n↳ Make it detailed. Write a lot here. \nWhen people search “Who is Anisha Jain?”, they see my experience tab on LinkedIn. \n\n8. Get Premium LinkedIn: \n↳ This gives you a special link under your name when posting. \nMore links mean more clicks and more conversions.\n\nAnisha and I wrote a guide to go from 0 to 10,000 followers.\n\nTo access it, simply click here → how-to-lkdn.ai",
