  "text": "I can't believe you use WordPress when there is AI:\n\n(And no. I'm not talking about ChatGPT)\n\nGamma is like ChatGPT meets WordPress.\n\n☑ Type any prompt (like ChatGPT).\n☑ Gamma generates the entire functional website.\n☑ Including AI images aligned with your branding.\n\nHere's how to test it for free (save for later):\n\n1. Go to gamma .app\n2. Create a free account.\n3. Click on \"Create new (AI)\".\n4. Click on \"Generate\".\n5. Select \"Webpage\" + write a prompt.\n5. Eg. \"Landing page for my digital course on AI\".\n6. Select 8-60 slides + Generate the outline.\n7. Validate the outline + theme to finalize it.\n\nYou can select how long each text slide is.\n\nYou can select which AI for the images (go for Flux Ultra - it will take longer, but the result is insane).\n\nHere you have it: a functional website, that you can edit with simple prompts, just like ChatGPT.\n\nHow? Go to the top right \"Edit all cards with AI\".\n\nNow real pros use Gamma differently:\n\n1. Click on \"Create new (AI)\".\n2. Instead of \"Generate\" → click \"Paste in text\".\n3. Add the entire outline of your website, for example.\n\nThat's it. You're done.\n\nYou have a full website.",
