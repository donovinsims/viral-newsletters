  "text": "I used to open ChatGPT 30+ times a day. \n\nNow I use these AI for images, writing, searching:\n\n1. Claude 4.5-Opus to write.\n2. Grok-4.1-Thinking to search.\n3. Perplexity for market research.\n4. Gemini (Nano+Veo) for images and videos.\n5. Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg.\n\n1. Claude 4.5-Opus to write.\n\n☑ Use custom styles.\n☑ Search before writing.\n☑ Here's a prompt example:\n\nPrompt: \"You're my research lead for \"How to AI\" newsletter. Find my next NL topic. What works: Counterintuitive AI findings (like my hit on rudeness improving ChatGPT), major launches the week they drop, hidden feature deep-dives, contrarian takes with data.\nSearch: This week's AI news with viral potential Arxiv for surprising LLM papers, Underreported OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Meta announcements, Emerging AI controversies. \nDeliver 10 options, each with:\nTopic (2-5 words), Angle (the hook), Source (link), Why it fits (one sentence)\nPrioritize \"I didn't know that\" over obvious news.\"\n\n2. Grok-4.1-Thinking to search.\n\n☑ The only AI that can search through Twitter.\n☑ The most accurate AI to find relevant news.\n☑ More prompts: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg.\n\nPrompt: “Act as a public opinion researcher. Your goal is to gauge polarized views on a hot-button issue, defining success as categorizing 30+ X posts into pro/con/neutral buckets with engagement metrics, backed by web snippets for context. Employ X semantic search with a query like ‘debate on [topic]’ excluding biased sources, and web search with snippets for ‘site:reddit.com [topic] OR site:news.com [topic]’.”\n\n3. Perplexity for market research.\n\n☑ The one AI made to search.\n☑ It has most of the LLMs inside, like ChatGPT.\n☑ I like the \"Discover\" tab, a better Google News.\n\nPrompt: \"Analyze [topic] in [timeframe], delivering data-driven insights and quantitative forecasts. Cover [key aspects], compare [variants], and provide actionable recommendations. Structure output with an executive summary and clear sections, citing all sources.\"\n\n4. Gemini (Nano+Veo) for images and videos.\n\n☑ The best AI to make both images and videos.\n☑ Nano-Banana vibecheck: https://lnkd.in/dZ96-CFS.\n☑ Prompt for infographic: https://lnkd.in/dh6g5MNd.\n☑ Prompt for pro headshot: https://lnkd.in/d5YBitjd.\n\n5. Copilot to do nothing. Delete it.\n\nI'll save you some time. It's the worst of them all.\nYou use it because your company forces you to.",
