  "text": "I would never post on my Linkedin before going to these sites first:\n\n1. ChatGPT, chat.com\n\nA no-brainer.\n\n✦ Deep Research topics.\n✦ Find trends, brainstorm angles.\n✦ Turn my learnings into repeatable GPTs. \n\nAnything I learn about growing on Linkedin, I teach it to ChatGPT. And then I turn it into my own GPT.\n\n2. Gamma, gamma.app\n\nFrom text to clean visuals fast.\n\n✦ Turn drafts into carousels or decks.  \n✦ Auto-layout, styles, and web export.  \n✦ Great for briefs and simple sites.\n\nI paste my outline and hit generate. Then I tweak copy and flow instead of wrestling with slides.\n\n3. EasyGen, easygen.io\n\nMy LinkedIn co-writer.\n\n✦ Turn raw notes into post drafts.  \n✦ Suggest hooks, CTAs, and variants.  \n✦ Predict topics likely to trend for me.\n\nI feed it ideas from DMs or comments. It returns five angles. Also obsessed with the \"Trending\" tab to know what went viral for me & other creators I stalk.\n\n4. Notion, notion.so\n\nWhere my content lives.\n\n✦ Calendar for drafts, posts, and repurposing.  \n✦ Templates for ideas, hooks, and carousels.  \n✦ Capture → edit → schedule in one place.\n\nI see gaps at a glance and avoid last-minute scrambling. I also post 3x a day, so it's necessary.\n\n5. Perplexity, perplexity.ai\n\nResearch with receipts.\n\n✦ Find breakout questions and topics.  \n✦ Cross-check sources to avoid blind spots.\n✦ Summarize papers, reports, even YouTube.  \n\nPerfect for backing claims with links. I pull stats, verify, and move on. Search better than ChatGPT.\n\n6. Grok, grok.com\n\nReal-time trend radar.\n\n✦ See what top accounts push now.  \n✦ Grab quotes to reference in posts.\n✦ Search tweets, threads, and memes fast.  \n\nEverything breaks on X before LinkedIn. Both platforms are so different, it's key to be on both.\n\n7. Canva, canva.com\n\nFast polish.\n\n✦ Carousels, infographics, thumbnails.  \n✦ Background remover and Magic Erase.  \n✦ Brand Kit to stay on-style.\n\nI keep a few templates and swap text. Looks pro without a designer. Best value for money.\n\n8. Opus Clip, opus.pro\n\nLong video → shorts videos.\n\n✦ Auto-cuts, captions, and punch-ins.  \n✦ Finds highlight moments by topic.  \n✦ Exports in every social size.\n\nI upload a talk or webinar. It finds the hooks and hands me publish-ready clips. Same with YouTube.\n\nI wrote an entire blog on \"How much money you should spend on AI\", highlighting three budgets.\n\n↳ $20/mo budget (that's the minimum)\n↳ $200/mo budget (that's my budget)\n↳ $2,000/mo budget (for the lunatics)\n\nTo access the full article, go here → best-ai.blog.",
