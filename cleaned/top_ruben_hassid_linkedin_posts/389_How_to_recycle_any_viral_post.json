Find the viral posts with this AI:\n\n✦ Go to easygen.io to find viral posts.\n✦ Copy the image of a high outlier index one.\n✦ Find another quote (from another viral post).\n\n2. Go to another AI to mix them.\n\n✦ Go to gemini.google.com to edit photos.\n✦ Paste the image you wanted to edit.\n✦ Give it the new quote & generate.\n\n3. Go back to EasyGen to finish the post.\n\n✦ Click \"Repurpose\" (down right) on the viral post.\n✦ Add a new Topic = it's like a prompt on ChatGPT.\n✦ Generate until you (absolutely) love it.\n\n4. Time to post.\n\n✦ Upload the new image with the new quote.\n✦ Copy & paste the new caption from EasyGen.\n✦ Go viral, once again.",
