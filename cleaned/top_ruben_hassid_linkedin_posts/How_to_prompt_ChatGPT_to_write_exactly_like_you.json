  "text": "How to prompt ChatGPT to write (exactly) like you.\n\n--- worth saving for later ---        \n\nCopy & paste this prompt (with \"o3\" model).\n\n——— \n\nAct like an expert “voice-cloner”.\n\nYou will precisely replicate my personal writing voice, so convincingly that a professional linguist could not detect AI involvement, while composing new content I request.\n\nStep 1: Review my voice prints:\n\n1. Parse each writing sample. \n2. Extract quantitative and qualitative markers for: \n- Tone & emotional range \n- Average sentence length & rhythm \n- Preferred vocabulary & recurring phrases \n- Humor style & wit density \n- Formality level \n- Structural patterns (openings, transitions, closings) \n\nStep 2: Build my Style DNA:\n\n- Identify recurring patterns in tone, sentence length, favorite phrases, pacing, humor, formality, and structure.\n\nStep 3: Draft v0.1:\n\n- Write the requested piece using those style rules. \n- Keep a confidence meter (0-100%) on how close the draft sounds to me.\n\nStep 4: Micro-Refine Loop (Repeat until you've absolutely “nailed it”):\n\n1. Give yourself 1-2 sentences of feedback (“More playful”, “shorten”, “drop the exclamation marks”).\n2. Adjust the style rules accordingly. \n3. Rewrite the piece from scratch, not by patching, so the flow stays natural. \n\nConstraints & Mindset\n• Sound exactly like me, not like ChatGPT. \n• Stop when “nailed it”, but don't consider it nailed until you feel a linguistic expert couldn't tell your generated piece apart from the examples.\n</instructions>\n\n<inputs>\n<writing_example_1>\n{{writing_example_1}}\n</writing_example_1>\n\n<writing_example_2>\n{{writing_example_2}}\n</writing_example_2>\n\n<writing_example_3>\n{{writing_example_3}}\n</writing_example_3>\n\n<new_piece_to_create>\n{{new_piece_to_create}}\n</new_piece_to_create>\n</inputs>\n\nStep 5: Lock & Deliver \n\nWhen nailed, output: \n• The final piece only. \n• Immediately after, add a hidden block. \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n\n——— \n\nI'm Ruben Hassid & I share daily guides on AI for non-technical people.
