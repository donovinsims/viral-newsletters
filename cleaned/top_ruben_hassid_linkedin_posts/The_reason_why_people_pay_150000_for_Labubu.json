  "text": "The reason why people pay $150,000 for 'Labubu'.\n\nPS. This was made by AI, here's how:\n\nThis is from the new \"Agent\" made by OpusClip.\n\n✦ Turn prompts into scripts into a full-flesh video.\n✦ They go beyond viral clips. They make the video.\n\nReplay link: https://lnkd.in/dw87n7yY\n\nAgent Opus isn't open to the public yet. You must join the waitlist & hopefully get access to it.\n\nBut I have a couple of accesses to give.\n\n You must have open DMs.",
