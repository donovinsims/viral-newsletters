  "text": "You ignore ChatGPT.\n\nBut that's how I steal viral hooks before you:\n\n☑ Go to chat.com/atlas.\n☑ Sign in with your ChatGPT account.\n☑ Open YouTube. Search your favorite creator.\n☑ Click ‘Ask ChatGPT’ on upper right.\n☑ Paste this prompt:\n\n“Identify the top 5 best-performing YouTube videos on {CHANNEL_NAME} from the last 5 months by views.\nFor each of those 5 videos, capture:\n1. The video title and thumbnail title verbatim\n2. The opening hook (~10 seconds verbatim from transcript)\n3. Abstract a HOOK PATTERN (= formula, not wording)\n4. Generate 5 hook templates using that pattern → each with 2 angles + 2 ideas on how to adapt to my niche ({YOUR_NICHE})\nEnd with:\n• A “Pattern Takeaways” section → 5 bullet insights (max)\n\nRules:\n– Use only verifiable data (views, titles, transcripts); don’t invent any numbers or wording.\n– If something is missing (e.g. no transcript), say so plainly instead of guessing.\n– Be concise and action-ready, no fluff.\n– Structure output exactly as:\n1. Title + views + publish age\n2. Hook (verbatim)\n3. Hook Pattern (formula)\n4. Templates + Angles + Adaptations\n5. Pattern Takeaways (5 bullets)\n\nIf you can’t figure something out, say it out loud and stop there.\nDon’t make stuff up.\n\nGoal: I want the same concise, structured pattern-analysis breakdown you gave me for {REFERENCE_CREATOR}’s channel.”\n\n→ Instantly, you get 5 viral videos with their opening hooks.\n→ You get a hook template for each, ready to use.\n→ Set Atlas to run it every day for a list of creators.\n→ You get a daily email reminder to do it.\n→ Build your own idea library from these hooks.\n→ Give a long form blog to convert into 5-6 hooks.\n→ Go to easygen, put the hook, pointers from your blog in ‘Post Topic’.\n→ Generate 3-4 post versions.\n→ Post on Linkedin.\n\nUse ChatGPT Atlas to turn viral hooks into your own.\n\nYou want more?
