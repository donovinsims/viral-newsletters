  "text": "NEWS: Gemini now creates PDFs.\n\nHere's exactly how, in simple steps:\n\n1. Go to Gemini. \n2. Click on 'tools' and select 'Canvas'.\n3. Make sure it's on 'Thinking' (bottom left).\n4. Use my prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dh6g5MNd. \n\nI asked for a short Solar System PDF with definitions, a blank diagram, a matching task.\n\nIt’s fully editable and ready to download and print.\n\nWhy it matters:\n • You can adjust materials to any reading level fast.\n • You can turn any resource into a worksheet. \n • You can create lesson plans faster.",
