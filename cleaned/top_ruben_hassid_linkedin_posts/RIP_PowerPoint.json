  "text": "RIP PowerPoint.\n\nIt's (almost) 2026. You must use this instead:\n\n1. gamma.app is the ChatGPT of slides.\n2. You type a prompt, or upload your PPT.\n3. It generates much, much better slides.\n\nThey have now added Gamma 2.0, with an agent.\n\n✦ It's a chat, on the side of your (existing) slides.\n✦ You ask for edits, and it makes for you, with taste.\n✦ It's not \"done-for-you\" but \"done-with-you\".\n\nPS: You must follow Grant, their CEO.\n\nHe's building a soon-to-be billion-dollar company with a 50-person team. And they do it with taste.\n\nHis Linkedin posts are my inspiration to hire the right way, not just to get bigger headcounts.\n\n___\n\n✦ Subscribe to my newsletter: how-to-ai.guide.\n✦ Favorite free AI guides: https://lnkd.in/dSj2SU9Z.\n✦ Grant & I wrote this too: https://lnkd.in/gyHZNrv2.",
