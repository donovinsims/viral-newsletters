  "text": "I can't believe this Pixar-like short was entirely made with AI. Here's exactly how:\n\n@BillyWoodward used a full stack of AI tools to create it:\n→ Midjourney: for the stunning visuals and style.\n→ Nano Banana: for camera angles and edits.\n→ Seedance + Kling 2.5: for motion and animation.\n→ Suno: for the music track in one go.\n→ Elevenlabs: for sound effects.\n\nAI can create images and clips. You're still the one creating it.\nQuality comes from the story you choose to tell.\n\nPS: I test AI tools daily and keep an updated list of my favorites. Check it out here: best-ai.blog.",
