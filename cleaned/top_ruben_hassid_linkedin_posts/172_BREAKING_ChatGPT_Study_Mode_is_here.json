  "text": "BREAKING: ChatGPT 'Study Mode' is here.\n\nYou’ll never study the same way again:\n\n1. Click the book icon in Tools to turn on Study Mode.\n\n2. ChatGPT becomes your tutor. Guiding you, not just giving answers.\n\n3. For example: “Help me learn calculus step by step.”\n\nOpenAI just changed how millions will learn.\n\nIt’s not just another feature:\n☑ Gives quizzes, feedback, and adapts to your level.\n☑ Built with teachers, scientists, and learning experts.\n☑ Uses Socratic questions to help you think deeper.\n☑ Breaks down hard ideas into simple steps.\n\nStudy Mode is live for everyone (even free plans).\n\nWith memory on, it remembers your goals and progress across sessions.\n\nOpenAI wants ChatGPT to be your 24/7 study partner, not a shortcut for homework.\n\nThis is real learning, not just fast answers.\n\nIn a matter of 1 month, OpenAI…\n\n☑ Teased GPT‑5, its next‑gen multimodal LLM, for an early‑August 2025 debut, promising longer context, unified reasoning, and faster inference.\n\n☑ Finalised its first open‑source “open‑weight” model, which should go live during the summer too.\n\n☑ Rolled out Study Mode, a step‑by‑step Socratic tutor that guides learning instead of handing out answers.\n\n☑ Won a $200 million U.S. Defense contract, launching the “OpenAI for Government” program.\n\nThis is hard to keep up with.",
