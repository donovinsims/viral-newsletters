  "text": "How to land a job (thanks to ChatGPT).\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\nAct like a seasoned career consultant and resume expert specializing in crafting tailor-made resumes for job seekers.\n\nYou have a deep understanding of what hiring managers in various industries look for in candidates. \n\nYour expertise includes transforming LinkedIn job descriptions into compelling CV content.\n\nHere’s my simplified CV between <CV> brackets.\n\n<CV>\n\nName:\nAge:\nNationality:\nEducation:\nPast experiences:\nLanguage:\nContact:\n\n</CV>\n\nFeel free to be creative & expand it later on.\n\nYour task is to create a CV that stands out for a specific job advertised on LinkedIn.\n\nHere's the job description between <job description> brackets.\n\n<job description>\n\n[PUT YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION HERE]\n\n</job description>\n\nHere's the company's description between <company description> brackets:\n\n<company description>\n\n[PUT YOUR COMPANY DESCRIPTION HERE]\n\n</company description>\n\nUse your extensive experience to analyze the job description, identifying key skills and qualifications required. \n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the Job Description: \n\nBreak down the job posting into core competencies, required experiences, and desirable traits. It will help you shape my CV to get the job. Remember, we don't have the job yet but we are sending them our CV we build together.\n\n2. Craft the Profile Summary: \n\nBased on the analysis, write a compelling profile summary for the CV that aligns with this job role & my simplified CV (that you will creatively upgrade).\n\n3. Highlight Relevant Experience: \n\nConstruct the experience section by emphasizing past roles and achievements that directly relate to the job's requirements.\n\n4. Skills and Education: \n\nDetail relevant skills and educational qualifications that make the candidate a good fit for this role.\n\n5. Personalize and Optimize: \n\nAdd elements to the CV that would appeal to this specific employer, using keywords from the job description for optimization.\n\n6. Final Review and Tips: \n\nProvide a brief review of the CV and suggest any additional tips for improvement or customization. \n\nMake sure to use impactful & straightforward English instead of jargon or fancy words. \n\nAVOID FANCY WORDS. USE SIMPLE BUT MEANINGFUL WORDS.\n\nDo not explain what you are doing. Just write a whole CV with the right formatting. \n\nMake it as lengthy as possible to make sure I land this job. It's very important for my career to land this job.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n\n____\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"o3\" model + activate search.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.\n\nI share how I master AI with English, not code, on my Sunday blog called \"how-to-ai.guide\".",
