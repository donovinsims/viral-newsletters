  "text": "You can't keep up with AI. Me neither.\n\nHere's what we must do instead:\n\n1. Pick your battle.\n☑ Pick one AI. A good start is ChatGPT.\n☑ Pick one task. A good start is writing [X] better.\n\n2. Play with it.\n☑ Try different prompts (= requests).\n☑ Try different models (gpt-4o, o3, gpt-4.5).\n☑ Try different features (Canvas, Deep Research).\n\nFor eg. \"Here's a good copy of [X]. Now help me write a new copy of [X], but considering [Y].\"\n\n3. Lower your expectations.\n☑ It is not god or an almighty intelligence.\n☑ It is a tool to do [X] better, faster, with taste.\n\n4. Finally, upgrade your expectations.\n☑ Now that you mastered one AI, connect them.\n☑ One can search. Another can generate an image.\n☑ Follow the \"pick one AI → play → iterate\" pattern.\n\n5. Take your time.\n☑ Technology goes fast. But people go slower.\n☑ Save this post for later when you open ChatGPT.\n☑ Go to the top right → three dots → \"Save\" post.",
