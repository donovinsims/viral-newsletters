  "text": "Give me 58 seconds, and I will DELETE your terrible prompt engineering on ChatGPT. \n\nYou write bad prompts on ChatGPT.\n\nBecause you commit the 7 deadly sins of prompting:\n\n1. No context (\"Analyze this\" with zero background)\n2. Vague instructions (\"Write about marketing\") \n3. Treating it like Google (questions vs prompts)\n4. Asking for everything at once (20 tasks in one)\n5. Not iterating (one prompt and done)\n6. Forgetting to specify format/tone\n7. No examples of what you want\n\nThe best prompt follow this rule:\n\n☑ [Here's what I need, and who you must be to do it]\n+ [Here's one/ more good examples of what I want]\n+ [After your first draft, I will tell why it's bad/good]\n\nIn others words:\n1. Role + Specific guidelines\n2. Example(s) of past good outputs\n3. Iterations from your own judgment\n\nThis is \"AI + Human\". Not \"AI instead of Human\".\n\nI wrote a blog on how to (really) prompt ChatGPT.\n\nTo access it, click here: https://lnkd.in/edwXnKRa",
