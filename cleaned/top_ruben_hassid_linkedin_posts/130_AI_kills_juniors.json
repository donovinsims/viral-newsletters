  "text": "AI kills juniors.\n\nIf you're under 30, don't make this mistake:\n\n→ AI did not make you better. \n☑ AI is the new 'bad'. Be better than AI (by using it).\n\n→ Diplomas won't give you a job.\n☑ Your portfolio will. Do things (with AI) & post it.\n\n→ \"I'm too late for the AI trend.\"\n☑ It's so, so early. Like the internet in 1990. \n\n→ AI is too large. Pick your battles.\n☑ Pick one thing & become the best at it (with AI).\n\n→ AI is not that hard.\n☑ A couple of hours of free content + a couple of weeks to play with it teach 80% of what you need.\n\n→ AI will be everywhere, especially in old schools.\n☑ Go into dinosaurs industries. Give it an AI twist.\n\n→ AI or not, content is king.\n☑ What you do = What you post = Your value.\n\n→ AI lacks taste & experience.\n☑ The best AI users mix it with taste & experience.\n☑ Find ways to sharpen them & train an AI on it.\n\n→ There is no better instructor than playing.\n☑ Open an AI tool. Try to get one result with it.\n☑ Playing (=\"vibing\") with AI is the way to master it.\n\n__\n\nI'm 28 years old.\n\nI didn't finish my master degree.\n\nBut I am reaching over 2 million impressions every day on Linkedin, closing multi 6-figure deals.\n\nNo one cares about my diploma.\nNo one cares about how \"AI replaceable\" I might be.\n\nInstead, I picked one expertise & I shared content on it for the past 2 years straight. 2 posts every day.\n\nNot every junior will suffer from AI. The best one will use AI to get an instant shortcut to the very top.\n\nIf you're not a junior, but want to help the ones from your network, consider",
