  "text": "You think AI can't replace doctors.\n\nBut you haven't seen this scared doctor:\n\n☑ He uploads an X-ray from a patient.\n☑ The AI predicts correctly the disease in 1 second.\n\nThe doctor has 20 years of experience.\n\nAnd AI is (arguably) 3 years old since its boom.\n\n↳ Now, imagine AI in 3 more years. Or 20 years.\n\n☑ You must master it today, before it masters you.",
