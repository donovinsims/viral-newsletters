  "text": "I added +330,213 followers in 1 year on Linkedin.\n\nIf I had to do it again, here's (exactly) how:\n\nBefore reading my guide, do this...\n\n✦ Save this for later.\n✦ Repost it ♻️ for others.\n✦ Send it to a friend who wants to start.\n✦ Read '0 to 10,000 followers' at how-to-lkdn.ai.\n✦ My advice is non-orthodox. Don't be mad at me.\n\n____\n\n1. Do's and Don't\n\nThe wrong way…\n\n✖ Cold email automations.\n✖ Joining pods to cheat the system.\n✖ Spreading AI comments like the plague.\n✖ AI Agent pretending to connect with your leads.\n✖ Copy & pasting what another successful guy did.\n\nThe right way…\n\nWriting good posts.\n\nGood is targeted. Good is helpful. Good is consistent and gets better. But how? Let’s dive in.\n\n2. Find your mission\n\nYour topics on Linkedin are too broad.\n\nSolve only ONE problem.\n\nMine is \"How to AI with English, not code.\"\n\nThis is not “everything about AI” or “everything technology related”. I don’t share about robots, coding, or politics.\n\nHere’s a list of other examples, my favorite one-clear-mission creators:\n\n✦ Justin Welsh: run a solopreneur business without ruining your life.\n✦ Codie Sanchez: how to own a small, profitable business.\n✦ Rory Flynn: how to use AI for images & videos.\n✦ Dan Go: on why to get & stay fit.\n✦ Reno Perry: land better jobs.\n\nIf you can’t explain it few words, you need help.\n\nSo I made this entirely free (and private) GPT for you to find your mission.\n\nMission-GPT: https://lnkd.in/dWEX92vd.\n\nOnce you have a mission, set up your profile.\n\n3. Write your (first) post\n\nMission = one problem to solve.\nPost = one (of the many) solutions to the problem.\n\nNow a post is:\n→ The right solution to the problem.\n→ The right angle to the right solution.\n→ The right format to the right angle.\n\nMission + Solution + Angle + Format.\nLet’s write one post together.\n\nPerplexity Research\n\nLet’s write a post for Miguel, who works in Finance.\nMission: Make investment understandable for rookies.\nSolution: What is an ETF?\nAngle: Explain ETF like I am grocery shopping.\nFormat: an infographic.\n\nNow I need 1) the right research 2) the right designs 3) the right caption.\n\n1 - I will be using Perplexity Research.\n✦ Go to Perplexity.ai & select '“Research”.\n✦ I shared this prompt: “Act like an experienced financial educator; explain ETFs through grocery-shopping analogies, contrast them with stocks & mutual funds.”\n\n2 - Go to Pinterest. Type “ETF infographic” or “Finance infographic”.\nCopy it, make it better, use Canva, or pay a (cheap) designer.\n\n3 - Go to EasyGen.io and paste your research under “Topic”.\n\nBonus: Use the new “trending” tab from EasyGen to copy any of your last viral posts. \n\nGo to the left menu > “Trending” > Check the highest “Outlier Index” (means most viral) > Click on “Repurpose” > Add a new topic > Get a new viral post. Few people will do it. The who will, congrats: you’ll be winning (more).\n\n4. How I win on Linkedin (with AI)\n\nI recorded a video on this link: how-to-lkdn.ai.",
