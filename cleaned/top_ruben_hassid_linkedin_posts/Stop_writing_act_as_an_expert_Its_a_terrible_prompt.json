  "text": "Stop writing ‘act as an expert.’ It’s a terrible prompt.\n\nAsk this to ChatGPT instead:\n\nGive it a clear persona that matches your task.\n\nBecause most people write prompts like this:\n\n→ Act as an expert marketer\n→ Act as a software engineer\n→ Act as a business consultant\n\n... and then wonder why the output feels generic. \n\nThat’s because you gave the model a generic role. \n↳ So it gives you generic content.\n\nThe fix? Be specific.\nHere’s how to upgrade your prompts:\n\n❌ Act as an expert marketer\n✅ Act as a conversion psychologist who crafts landing pages that trigger buyer emotions.\n\n❌ Act as a software engineer\n✅ Act as a backend engineer optimizing high-load APIs for a fintech platform.\n\n❌ Act as a data analyst\n✅ Act as a storytelling analyst, turning retention metrics into board-ready slides.",
