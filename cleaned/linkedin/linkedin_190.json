  "text": "RIP software.\n\nThis AI builds any software (in seconds):\n\nAnd no. I don't talk about Lovable, but Blink.\n\nIt took me 10 minutes to 1) prompt 2) create 3) host on a domain 4) and make an entire software usable.\n\nHere's the step-by-step (from the video):\n\n1. Go to Blink .new\n2. Upload pictures of the software you want to copy.\n3. Or give it a prompt. Here's mine from the video:\n\nPrompt: \"Build an AI SEO article writer. It writes an article in stages: first, you provide the URL of your website, then it scrapes and shows you your website with its analysis of your business, target audience, market, product pricing, etc., to show you how the writer deeply understands your business. saves this analysis and then uses it to generate SEO article topics / content suggestion list. You can pick one to start writing. It will first research and draft an outline based on SERP research. Then, it will research each topic to gather real data to write about, and finally write each section. It also allows you to view the rendered markdown and give it comments to revise it.\"\n\n4. Once you have generated the software, test it.\n5. If there is an error, say it. It will correct it right away.\n6. You can connect your Stripe to receive payments.\n7. It's already hosted on a domain (a website to visit).\n\nThe software industry is worth over $200 billion.\n\nAnd AI is replacing it with screenshots & prompts.",
