  "text": "I can't believe this Pixar-like movie was made with AI in exactly 12 hours. Here's exactly how: \n\n1. ChatGPT → Created a shot list\n2. Midjourney's Omni → Kept characters consistent\n3. Kling and Pixverse → Brought the animation to life\n4. Photoshop → Enhanced two key shots\n5. Kitchen shot → Made it pop\n6. Giant black wall → Expanded for effect\n7. 12 hours → From idea to finished short\n\nCredit: \"Before Colours Fade\" from @impossibilia (from the subReddit r/aivideo, a must for AI lovers).",
