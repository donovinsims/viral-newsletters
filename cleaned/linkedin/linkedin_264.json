  "text": "This AI is the \"ChatGPT to find people\".\n\nAnd I can't believe what just happened:\n\nIt's called 'DeepLookup' (from BrightData).\n\n1. It's free. You create an account in like 1 min.\n2. You prompt it like ChatGPT, \"Find all [x people]\".\n3. You wait 15 min, and it scrapes the WHOLE web.\n4. Export your entire list on an Excel list, with URLs.\n\nChatGPT can't. Not even Linkedin.\n\nI just found every single CMO of AI SaaS companies in the US that has $x amount of funding.\n\nThis should take weeks, and $$$$ of dollars.",
