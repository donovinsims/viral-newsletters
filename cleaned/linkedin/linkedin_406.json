  "text": "Stop using ChatGPT for everything.\n\nHere is a better AI, for each category:\n\n1. ChatGPT + slides = gamma.app\n\n☑ It's much better than PowerPoint.\n☑ Create beautiful decks in seconds.\n☑ Works like ChatGPT, with text prompts.\n\n2. ChatGPT + writing = claude.ai\n\n☑ It's much better to write with taste.\n☑ It sounds better, more human than ChatGPT.\n☑ Pro tip: teach it your \"style\", it's the best feature.\n\n3. ChatGPT + voice-to-text = wispr.ai\n\n☑ It's much better than typing.\n☑ Correct it once, and Wispr will remember it.\n☑ Trying it truly feels like magic. Super accurate.\n\n4. ChatGPT + video editing = opus.pro\n\n☑ It's much better than Adobe Premiere Pro.\n☑ Upload your long video, or your YouTube link.\n☑ It generates 20-40 perfect Tiktok-like videos.\n\n5. ChatGPT + vibecoding = blink.new\n\n☑ It's much better than WordPress.\n☑ Treat like ChatGPT, but to build anything.\n☑ Apps, websites, softwares, sky is the limit.\n\n6. ChatGPT + searching the web = perplexity.ai\n\n☑ It's much better than Google.\n☑ The entire company's mission is to find answers.\n☑ My go-to is to prompt both Perplexity + ChatGPT.\n\n7. ChatGPT + artsy images = midjourney.com\n\n☑ It's much better than any other AI for images.\n☑ It's been years Midjourney is ahead. It still is.\n☑ Do not expect perfect text, but artsy images.\n\n8. ChatGPT + music = suno.com\n\n☑ It's much better than any other AI for music.\n☑ Feels like magic: type a prompt, get music.\n☑ Some of them went viral already on Spotify.",
