  "text": "How to animate images with AI.\n\nA Midjourney step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Go to midjourney.com\n2. Type a prompt to generate an image. \n3. Once you made it, go to the bottom right side.\n4. Click on 'animate image' with the proper setting.\n5. 'Auto' = you don't prompt it. 'Manual' = you do.\n6. Low/High to change the movement's intensity.\n\nHow to make better Midjourney prompts instantly:\n\n☑ Step 1: Don't prompt it (yourself).\n☑ Step 2: Instead, go to Midjourney's homepage.\n☑ Step 3: Use their search bar. Type any keyword.\n\nYou will have access to every image generated by Midjourney's users. \n\nYou like one? Click on the image, copy its prompt, edit it, and generate it yourself.\n\nMidjourney is one of the many tools I like to test.\n\nI wrote a guide on my current favorite AI tools (I update it every week).
