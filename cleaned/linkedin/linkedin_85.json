  "text": "Save this ChatGPT tree before your next prompt.\n\nStep 1: is it like a Google Search? \n\n☑️ No: use gpt-4o.\n\n☑️ Yes: use o3 reasoning.\n\nStep 2: If you pick o3 reasoning:\n→ Need more than 10 sources?\n\n☑️ No: Continue. Upload PDFs, CSVs, images. \no3 (much) better at reading & analysing long PDFs.\n\nPrompt example:  \nAct like [expertise]. Here’s [CSV]. Here’s my context: [context]. Question 1 – 2 – 3.\n\n☑️ Yes: Deep Research. \nClick on “Tools” and select “Run deep research”.\nMake sure “Web search” is turned on.\nConnect more data with “Connect more”.\n\nPrompt example:  \nI want [results] with [constraints]. [What/How/Why] has been [results]?\n\nAfter deep research:\n\n→ Download PDF.  \n→ Ask for step-by-step plan.  \n→ Share link to others.\n\nStep 3: If you pick GPT‑4o\n\n☑️ Create images → Write an image prompt. \n\nPrompt example:\n\"Create image remake this photo taken from a book, with same low-quality, yellow highlighted text, and film-grain from a book. But change the quote for this: \"YOUR QUOTE\"\n\n☑️ Use voice mode → Write a translation prompt. \n\nPrompt example:\n\"Act as a pro bilingual voice translator. First ask: \"Who are the 2 speakers & their native languages?\" Then translate each side’s words clearly, preserving tone. Be neutral. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step‑by‑step.\"\n\n☑️ Use more connectors → Gmail, Teams, Outlook, Google Drive, HubSpot and more.\n\n☑️ Use prompting technique:\n- Start with a role\n- State the task\n- Give brief context\n- Quote the input\n- Name the audience\n- Set the goal\n- Limit the length\n- Fix output form\n- Ask for silent think\n- Cue creativity\n- Ban unwanted words",
