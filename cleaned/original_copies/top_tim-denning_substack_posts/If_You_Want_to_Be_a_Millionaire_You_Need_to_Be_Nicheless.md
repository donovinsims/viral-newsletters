# If You Want to Be a Millionaire, You Need to Be Nicheless

### Being nicheless is a higher state of consciousness

Share

The average person doesn’t understand millionaires.

They see them on TV but they don’t have any who are close friends. They can’t see behind the story millionaires present to the public to protect their wealth and steer people away from the real opportunities.

I am a millionaire. Many of my friends are.

What I’ve noticed is none of us have a useless freaking niche, yet this is the cliche advice handed out to the masses as if it’s the key to getting into heaven.

# Millionaires are generalists

In business, we’re told to choose a niche.In writing, we’re told to choose a niche.In our 9-5 careers, we’re told to choose a niche.

They’re all wrong.

So where does this bad advice come from? It’s tied to a bigger societal problem. We’re taught to think small. To choose the default path. To get a hyper niche college degree and specialize forever.

All of this leads to mediocrity.

Choosing a niche knocks the creativity out of you. It puts you in a nice little f*cking box with a bow on it. It’s the #1 way to face enormous competition and beg for customers or opportunities.

All the millionaires I know are generalists, not one-trick ponies working at a circus for $5 an hour. They can take success in any field and apply it to another.

# Being nicheless gives you versatility

People think I make all my money from writing. Wrong.

Like most millionaires, I have multiple income streams – newsletters, affiliate revenue, books, coaching, courses, templates. And my biggest source of hidden money: investing.

> You need to be an all-rounder to be a millionaire.

You need to be an all-rounder to be a millionaire.

The chance you’ll make big money from one tiny niche is unlikely. Thinking you’ll become a 0.0001% outlier is the Hollywood dream that ruins many lives. Why? It makes you play stupid games that involve lottery-style math to have success.

# Forget the “pick a niche” advice. You don’t know what works yet.

This is the big problem.

Choosing a niche is assuming you know what works. It assumes you’ve found the path to wealth already and know everything.

But most people:

* Choose the wrong niche
* Choose a niche that doesn’t match their lifestyle
* Choose a niche that doesn’t match their personality
* Choose an outdated niche that doesn’t work anymore

Choose the wrong niche

Choose a niche that doesn’t match their lifestyle

Choose a niche that doesn’t match their personality

Choose an outdated niche that doesn’t work anymore

I can tell you to run daily sales webinars to runners in New York and sell them running shoes, but if you’re an introvert and hate public speaking, you’ll fail.

And if you don’t like running or only half-like running, you won’t have enough energy or passion to convert strangers into customers.

# Being nicheless is a higher state of consciousness

One of the reasons humans obsess over niches is because of our psychological programming.

In the beginner stages of life – that most adults never progress out of – we’re taught to be narrow-minded in our thinking. As you progress to higher states of consciousness the world starts to look different.

I realized about 5 years ago that everything is connected to everything.

* To master writing you need to understand copywriting.
* To master copywriting you need to understand marketing.
* To master marketing you need to know sales.
* To master sales you need to understand funnels.
* To understand funnels you need to understand online business.
* To understand online business you need to understand how the internet works.

To master writing you need to understand copywriting.

To master copywriting you need to understand marketing.

To master marketing you need to know sales.

To master sales you need to understand funnels.

To understand funnels you need to understand online business.

To understand online business you need to understand how the internet works.

… I could keep going on this thread in an infinite loop.

Understanding it helps glue everything together. A failure to understand human psychology guarantees you fail at whatever goals you have in life.

Because 101 of human psychology is we all think roughly the same and we can’t override our human programming. Another key component is humans are tribal.

We run a million miles away from selfishness.

Most people fail at their niche because they think about themselves and not broader humanity. To think about humans as a whole requires you to think bigger, and to do things that may not immediately benefit you.

As you start to transcend into higher states of consciousness – that’s not taught in school, jobs, or university – the world looks different. You see humans as one. You begin to notice we’re part of a much bigger universe.

This sudden transformation leads you to chase a higher purpose in life. That purpose helps you operate daily in never-ending flow states.

As you start to do this, the law of attraction kicks in, and you suddenly meet higher-quality humans who give you better answers and solve some of your hardest problems with ease.

So…

Choosing a niche is the most narrow-minded, useless, stupid way to look at our complex world.

Until you go beyond the surface you’ll never experience the depth that comes with being nicheless, where the world feels abundant and overflowing with money & opportunities.

# Common advice about niches that’ll make you go bankrupt

Let’s crush these B.S. cliches once and for all.

### “The riches are in the niches.”

If the riches are in the niches, why isn’t everyone who follows this advice rich?

Poverty is found in the niches because most people double down on a market smaller than a bee’s d*ck then try to beg people for money. After 3 months they get tired because their niche is so small there’s not much to say or do.

### “Nicheless people lack focus.”

Millionaires can focus on multiple things at the same time without getting distracted by a Pokemon video on TikTok split-screened with a looping video of Gordon Ramsay eating a hot dog.

Hyper-focusing on one area may give focus for a week, but it’ll get so boring, you’ll give up on the niche in under a year. The worst decision you can ever make is applying focus to an idea that has no traction yet.

Being single-minded leads to poverty. It closes you off from other opportunities and forces people to stay stuck in their tiny niche when they should probably pivot.

### “You must pick a niche.”

Be careful of gurus.

They spread rules and strategies as a form of lead magnet. Common advice is often the worst advice. You don’t have to do anything. You’re as free as a bird. Throughout your lifetime you will become obsessed with many niches.

Here’s my niche timeline as an example:

* 12 years old – obsessed with becoming a world-famous drummer.
* 16 years old – obsessed with becoming a DJ.
* 21 years old – obsessed with becoming an electronic music artist.
* 24 years old – obsessed with becoming an entrepreneur.
* 26 years old – obsessed with becoming a banker.
* 27 years old – obsessed with becoming a stock broker.
* 28 years old – obsessed with becoming a business leader
* 29 years old – obsessed with becoming a writer.
* 32-38 years old – obsessed with online business.

12 years old – obsessed with becoming a world-famous drummer.

16 years old – obsessed with becoming a DJ.

21 years old – obsessed with becoming an electronic music artist.

24 years old – obsessed with becoming an entrepreneur.

26 years old – obsessed with becoming a banker.

27 years old – obsessed with becoming a stock broker.

28 years old – obsessed with becoming a business leader

29 years old – obsessed with becoming a writer.

32-38 years old – obsessed with online business.

You’re a multi-interest human being.

No one just cares about one topic for life. We read lots of topics. We write about many too. The niches we love changes as we enter different phases of life.

Pro tip: don’t choose a niche. Follow your curiosity down rabbit holes and see where it takes you.

# The breathtakingly simple mindset to become nicheless (and make millions)

Ready?

Become the niche.

Translation: you are the niche.

Humans find other humans more interesting than they do reading about single topics or following some useless guru who only ever talks about google cloud all day.

Think about it. Are you reading this Substack right now because you signed up for my “niche?” Nope. I don’t have a niche. This isn’t a newsletter about psychology, money, freedom, business, writing. It’s all of those things.

You’re here because you resonate with the ideas I share. You’re interested in my view of the world (even if you don’t agree with every part). You’re here to think differently.
