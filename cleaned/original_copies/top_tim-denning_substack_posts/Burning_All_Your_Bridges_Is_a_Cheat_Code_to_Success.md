# Burning All Your Bridges Is a Cheat Code to Success

### Let it all burn to the ground and smile.

“Don’t burn your bridges” he said as I walked out of the office for the final time.

It was my last day in banking. I had a bad boss. The temptation to go tell him to F himself was overwhelming. How delicious it would have felt.

A few weeks later he got fired. He’s now been unemployed for 4 years.

I believed in not burning my bridges. I hoarded phone contacts, kept banking training manuals and kept up appearances with LinkedIn connections in case I ever needed them.

In my final 9-5 job in IT, something shifted in me.

I chose to burn my bridges. I burned my whole damn career to the ground so I never had to go back. It’s bizarrely the best decision I’ve ever made.

# Burning your bridges frees you from the past

It’s easy to get trapped by the past.

I was a banker. It’s hard to let go of that identity. I used to blog on Wordpress sites. That trend is now dead but it’s hard to let go of.

I used to be one the most well-known writers on Medium dot com. Now the site is dead and writing online has forever changed, thanks to the return of free speech and the removal of gatekeepers. It’s hard not to reminisce about the glory days of Medium.

But one thing life has taught me is we go through many deaths.

And those who win in life are reborn over and over again. The way you experience a rebirth is by burning your bridges.

When you can’t return to a past life it sets you free. The decision is removed. The option is taken away. The only solution is to move forward down a new path.

# Burning your bridges is an acceptance of change

The only people who lose in life are those who refuse to change.

It scares the hell out of me when I meet someone who just won’t change. Particularly people obsessed with politics. They’re so programmed by the mainstream media they can’t dare to consider the opposite side of a debate.

Being able to burn your bridges means you CAN accept change. You embrace change. You know life never stays the same and you don’t want it to.

When I started writing on LinkedIn 11 years ago, I burned my bridges. I used my real name which meant whatever I said there I could never take back. I would forever be seen at my workplace as some sort of public figure whether I liked it or not.

I could have used a nickname, but my instincts told me to go all in and use my real name so there was no doubt what I’d eventually become. And I became the writer I set out to be because there was no other option.

Our identity is powerful. Being able to become completely different people throughout your life is a superpower. Burning your bridges helps you do that.

I started out as a drummer, then musician/producer, then a 20-something entrepreneur, then banker, then writer, then father… and now, well, I don’t know what I am now haha. Still trying to figure that out.

Being a chameleon means you can do anything and become anybody you want to. It’s an acceptance that anything is possible.

To change identities you must be able to burn all your bridges.

# The hardest bridge you’ll ever burn

A few years ago, I burned the bridges attached to my childhood.

I stopped talking to my best friend because he was a drug addict. I quit talking to my manager from my music days because it was like talking to an alien. And I cut off former romantic partners to finally heal and move on. I deleted all of their contact details and unfriended them on platforms like Facebook (Meta).

There’s no going back.

What’s bizarre is I’m still haunted by my childhood. Every night I go to bed and have nightmares. They always occur from the age of 12-18.

I don’t mind it. It helps me to remember the evil that could’ve happened if I kept hanging around low-lifes and criminals. I won’t share the nightmares with you other than to say they’re full of drugs and guns.

There’s nothing wrong with burning the bridge to the town you were born in, or the friends you had at school or university.

Many times these are the people who hold us back. They hold on to the person we were decades ago instead of accepting who we are now.

Our childhood connections serve a purpose, but everyone has an expiry date.

Different phases of life require different types of people around you. A rowdy alcoholic who jumps in front of cars outside a nightclub is fine when you’re 18 (hi Greg!), but at 38, it’s just sad.

# The simple strategy to burn your bridges

Burning your bridges is dangerous if you do it the wrong way. Trust me, I’ve done it.

### Rule #1 – No ego

Ego is the enemy. Never forget that.

As you say goodbye to one part of your life, it’s easy to raise your middle finger and say “Adios ya sucker.” Don’t do this.

When I left Medium I could’ve published the old “I’m leaving Medium because it sucks” type post that we’ve seen plenty of recently. But I didn’t. Why?

It’s a waste of time. The platform doesn’t care. They won’t change. They won’t listen. And most of all, it’s not their fault. They think they’re making a better internet. I disagree. Doesn’t mean I’m right. They’re doing the best they can.

Ego is ugly. It’s a trap. It turns potential collaborators off. People don’t want to work with someone who has a big ego – at least not for long.

Humility is real s*xiness. People fall in love with it. Humility brings you more opportunities post-breakup.

### Rule #2 - Don’t explain yourself

A reader sent me an angry email the other day.

They hate that I now talk about money. They want me to go back to being a romantic writer who’s doing it for the love of it. But I’m not that person anymore. Writing without a business behind it is just a hobby that’ll die because there won’t be resources to help it grow.

I was tempted to send the reader an email explaining myself. Instead, all I said was “People change.”

As you attempt to explain yourself you end up in arguments. And the process can help you build a case for going back to the old you which is a disaster.

Society rarely understands us. Society wants us to be normal. So, when we buy a Tesla but tell people we don’t like Elon Musk’s personality although we respect the businesses he’s built, they can’t process it.

Their brains see black and white when the world is a rainbow.

The only person you owe answers to is yourself. Justify yourself to no one. Resist being normal at all costs.

### Rule #3 – It’s okay to ghost

Normally ghosting is a sign of a piss-weak person who can’t make decisions.

When it comes to burning bridges, ghosting is a gift from heaven. The average person will stop trying to contact you after 1-2 attempts. By ghosting them you don’t have to explain yourself or hear their sales pitch for going back to the old you.

Remember: An email, phone call or text message is a request – not an obligation.

### Rule #4 – Avoid temptation

As soon as you burn a bridge it’s tempting to go right back.

Just like sugar and p*rn are tempting and can ruin your life, so too can going back to an old life that didn’t give you what you wanted. Resist the urge.

If it didn’t work before it’s not going to work again.

When you choose a new path the beauty is you’ll be forced to make it work. Your mammal instincts and human ability to overcome immense struggles are what will get you to the next level.

We’re meant to play the role of several different characters in life. Allow yourself to play the new part even though it’s difficult to make the transition.

# The end is the start of a new beginning

Let one phase of life end so you can start the next phase by burning your bridges.

Light the bridge on fire. Let it go up in a blaze of glory. Make peace with it. See the benefit of it. Embrace the chaos that follows. Appreciate how far you’ve come. Let the calmness take over once the bridge is gone and there’s no way back.

Bridges look spectacular as they burn.
