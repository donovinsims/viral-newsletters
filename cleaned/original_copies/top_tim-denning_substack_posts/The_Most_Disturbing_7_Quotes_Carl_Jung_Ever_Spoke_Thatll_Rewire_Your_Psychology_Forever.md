# The Most Disturbing 7 Quotes Carl Jung Ever Spoke (That'll Rewire Your Psychology Forever)

### From the world's most influential psychologist

Share

Carl Jung has been dead for 70 years, yet people are still obsessed with him.

He’s the most influential psychologist of modern history. He has more fans than Joe Rogan or the President of the United States.

Why is that?

Because his tiny quotes of wisdom will rewire your psychology forever if you pay attention. Our psychology determines how we think.

If you reprogram your psychology, everything in your life changes.

Carl Jung has been doing that for years from the grave. But his advice is often deeply disturbing. It can even be offensive.

Here are the most disturbing quotes from Carl Jung, and how to use them in your life.

# 1. “What you resist not only persists but will grow in size.”

We’re brainwashed into being like everyone else.

The world can’t wait to tell you what to do and assign you generic labels that limit you. As you get older there’s a quiet voice in the back of your mind that tells you to stop resisting and do what you know you must do.

Most of us ignore that voice out of fear.

This leads to another idea from Carl Jung:

“Every human life contains a potential, if that potential is not fulfilled, then that life was wasted.”

Most people aren’t depressed or unhappy. They’re pissed off on the inside because they know deep down they’re not living up to their potential. The more they resist their true calling the bigger the painful regrets grow.

Once you understand this your life is never the same again.

### How to apply it:

Stop resisting.

Take the risk. Do the scary thing. Leave the person behind. Start the business. Try to earn multiple streams of income doing something you give a sh*t about. Otherwise all you have is envy, regret, hate & anger that get bigger until eventually they destroy you.

Now you know why normal people are so angry and love the news.

# 2. "The world will ask you who you are, and if you do not know, the world will tell you."

The default path is a nightmare.

It leads people to live on auto-pilot and get told what to do, whether they realize it or not. Like it or not, this is how you become oppressed.

That’s why school, college, and corporations can’t wait to tell you what you should do.

They love to use fancy labels to describe you, so they can manipulate your next move to align with their incentives. This isn’t some evil conspiracy, it’s just capitalism 101. Incentives drive behavior.

Just ask the management consultant who gets a promotion and 10% more money, only to realize that instead of working from 8 AM until 6 PM, they’ll now be working from 7 AM until midnight.

### How to apply it:

Figure out what you are going to do with your life. Experiment. Talk to people outside of your bubble. Learn from failures and rejection instead of gurus and empty advice.

Do the thing you can’t stop thinking about, despite how it feels.

# 3. “I am not what happened to me, I am what I choose to become.”

I spent years as a victim.

Psychologists gave me the mental illness label and I embraced it. I thought my life suddenly made sense. “This was out of my control,” I thought.

So then I felt free. For a few days. Until I realized if I was not in control of my life and the thoughts I had, then there was nowhere for me to go.

I was broken beyond repair.

Broken things go to the rubbish dump. Broken humans jump off bridges.

Then I discovered this quote from Carl Jung, and mixed it with some philosophies from Tony Robbins. Suddenly I was in full control again.

Bad sh*t is always gonna happen, but what are you gonna do with it?

### How to apply it:

All situations that happen to you come with a choice. Is this event going to empower you or destroy you? You get to decide.

There’s nothing better than an underdog making a comeback.

# 4. “The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm that is not easily disturbed.”

I am chill as hell.

Throughout life I’ve had some boulders thrown at me. Partners that cheated on me, nearly being murdered at 16, alcoholism, working in a strip club as a DJ, theft of $1.2M, driving a limo at 18 with dangerous drug dealers, multiple startup failures, being publicly fired and having to tell 200,000 people on LinkedIn.

These setbacks tell me I can deal with anything.

Each failure or rejection has forced me to get on with it and make new decisions. In the process, I’ve made new friends and learned powerful strategies to destroy negativity.

They sit on the couch and watch other people live the life they should be living. Or they idolize heroes because they have no courage. They spend their time wishing and hoping something big will happen.

But when you get good at resolving conflicts, you unlock a limitless mind.

Nothing stands in your way anymore. No one’s opinion makes you give a flying f*ck. And critics are just free marketers for your way of life and multiple income streams.

### How to apply it:

Think back to the times you’ve failed or been rejected.

See these events as a source of strength. Let them give you the confidence that you can overcome hard things. And if you overcame that tragic event, then what other challenges might you be able to overcome?

Answer: anything.

(Limitless mindset now unlocked.)

# 5. “The first half of life is devoted to forming a healthy ego, the second half is going inward and letting go of it”

A reader messaged me: “You’re an a-hole that can’t take feedback.”

We hadn’t interacted for 5 years. They were right. I told him, “Yes, 2019 Tim Denning was an a-hole … it’s a shame you don’t know 2024 me.”

The first half of my life was full of ego and status-chasing. Fast cars, chasing blonde chicks through nightclubs as a DJ, drinking until I passed out, and stupid banking job titles that meant nothing.

At 34 the second part of my life started. It’s the opposite. Ryan Holiday’s book “Ego is the Enemy” woke me up. I freaking hate big egos now. I run in the other direction when I encounter one.

Once you let go of your ego, reality looks different.

How you spend your time and energy transforms overnight. And suddenly your life, job, network, and content consumption change.

### How to apply it:

Ditch ego-driven tasks and pursuits right now. Let the second part of your life start early, so you can experience true meaning.

# 6. "You are what you do, not what you say you'll do."

Mediocrity exists when you think:

* “I’ll do this someday.”
* “I hope X will happen.”
* “I’ve got that on my to-do list.”
* “When things aren’t so busy I’ll get to it.”

“I’ll do this someday.”

“I hope X will happen.”

“I’ve got that on my to-do list.”

“When things aren’t so busy I’ll get to it.”

Action is all that matters. I’ll go a step further: what you do today is all that matters. Because tomorrow doesn’t exist and you aren’t guaranteed more alive time. Cancer rates are skyrocketing out of control.

> What makes you think you’re too special for cancer?

What makes you think you’re too special for cancer?

I wasn’t.

The cliche quote, “Yesterday you said tomorrow” applies here. Actions show people who you are, and everything else is a distraction that makes you a liar.

Liars are perpetually broke.

### How to apply it:

Look at your to-do list. Delete 90% of it. Then act today on what’s left. Create a sense of urgency. Live as if tomorrow doesn’t exist.

# 7. “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate”

Carl Jung went so deep into the mind that some say he lost his mind.

In 1931, at 38, Carl started to see visions and hear voices. He thought it might be schizophrenia or psychosis. He thought he lost touch with reality.

But this period of his life produced some of his greatest wisdom (like this quote above). He began to learn about the unconscious mind and its power. The unconscious mind doesn’t allow you to interrogate it.

It’s where auto-pilot behavior and thinking occurs.

In this quote, he tried to explain how our unconscious mind bizarrely directs our lives. And that if you let auto-pilot mode have too much power, you fall for the lies of fate and luck. This will ultimately lead you to become a powerless victim.

We now know that we can have power over our unconscious mind through:

* Meditation
* Visualization
* Positive self-talk
* Positive thinking
* NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) that leads to neuroplasticity

Meditation

Visualization

Positive self-talk

Positive thinking

NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) that leads to neuroplasticity

### How to apply it:

Most of society is asleep.

They’re technically awake… but their phones transport them out of the physical world and into an unconscious digital world.

Their thoughts are automated, therefore, their trajectory in life is fixed. Don’t be one of these common people. Take back your life. Spend less time on your phone scrolling algorithmic feeds designed for robots. And…

Dare to meditate or study NLP.
