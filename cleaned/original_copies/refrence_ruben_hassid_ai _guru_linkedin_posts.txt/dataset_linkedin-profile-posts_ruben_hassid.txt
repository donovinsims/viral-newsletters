  "text": "You're stuck on an endless loop with ChatGPT.\n\nHere's how to get out of it (3 steps):\n\n1. Recognize the loop.\n\nLLMs like ChatGPT hallucinate.\n\nThey get stuck in endless loops of answers, without taking into consideration your follow-up prompts.\n\nI realized that:\n☑ No prompt engineering can get you out.\n☑ It happens more with \"search\" activated.\n☑ It happens more on gpt-4o (non-reasoning).\n\nHere's what to do instead:\n\n2. Edit past prompts.\n\n☑ Instead of writing follow-up prompts...\n↳ Edit your past prompt with a different approach.\n\n☑ Instead of brute forcing a model like gpt-4o...\n↳ Edit a past prompt + change the model.\n\nBut the very best solution is obviously to...\n\n3. Start all over again.\n\n☑ Choose the o3 model over anything else.\n↳ It's the one that hallucinates the least.\n\n☑ Avoid searching + reasoning at the same time.\n↳ Search first and then follow up with reasoning.\n\n☑ Ask to think step by step.\n↳ Not everything, all at once. Lay down the steps.\n\nIf you learned something, give it a ♻️ reshare."

  "text": "You underestimate good ChatGPT prompts.\n\nHere are the 17 golden rules of ChatGPT:\n\n1. Start with a Role\n  “Act like \\[expert]” so ChatGPT adopts the right expertise and tone.\n\n2. State Your Objective\n  Skip “Hi” & “Thank you.” Begin with a concise mission.\n\n3. Tell Who It’s For\n  “Explain to someone who knows nothing about the topic.”\n\n4. Use Positive, Direct Commands\n  “List three reasons,” not “Don’t forget to avoid mistakes.”\n\n5. Break Big Tasks into Steps\n  Step 1: “Write an outline.”\n  Step 2: “Fill in each point with details.”\n\n6. Provide Clean Examples\n  Show “input → output.” Keep them uniform and tightly focused on what you want.\n\n7. Ask for the Format\n  Tell it exactly how to structure: “Send a table with two columns.”\n\n8. Choose Your “Shots”\n\n  * Zero‑shot: “Translate to French.”\n  * One‑shot: Provide one example.\n  * Few‑shot: Supply 3–5 labeled examples separated by ###.\n\n9. Set Simple Limits\n  Limit length, style, or content: “No more than 100 words.”\n\n10. Invoke Frameworks\n  Tap AIDA, PAS, or your own frameworks: “Follow PAS model: Problem → Agitate → Solve.”\n\n11. Provide Precise Feedback\n  Point to the line or bullet: “In bullet # 2, add a statistic on market growth.”\n\n12. Ask for Chain‑of‑Thought\n  For transparency, request “Show your reasoning step by step,” or “Think aloud in bullet points.”\n\n13. Skip Polite Words\n  No need for “please” or “thank you.” Just say what you need.\n\n14. Iterate on Your Prompts\n  Compare variants. Use the one that performs best.\n\n15. Repeat or Emphasize Key Points\n  “Remember: brief, clear, and friendly.”\n\n16. Try Different Wording\n  Compare “Summarize X” vs. “Give me a quick recap of X.”\n\n17. Use an Encouraging Cue\n  “Take a deep breath, then walk through each step one at a time.”\n\n__\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more (I post twice a day)."

Go to your Linkedin profile > \"Impressions\".\nStep 3. Click \"past 365 days\" > \"Export\" (top right).\n\nLinkedin will give you a csv. file of your last posts.\n\n☑ Upload it on ChatGPT + copy & paste this.\n☑ Make sure to change every {{placeholder}} first.\n\nPrompt: \"Act as a LinkedIn Content Calendar Architect.\n\nYour mission: turn my past-post CSV into a 30-day plan that grows reach and qualified leads.\n\nSTEP 1 File check  \n\n• If no CSV is attached, reply exactly: UPLOAD CSV FIRST.  \n• Load the first attached UTF-8 file.  \n• Ignore rows containing “Total” or “Overall.”\n\nSTEP 2 Ask me:  \n\na) Primary success metric (Impressions, Reactions, Comments, or column name).  \nb) Preferred posting days (default daily).  \nc) Tone keywords (e.g., direct, playful).  \nd) Core CTA goal (e.g., book a demo, newsletter signup).  \ne) Start date (or “auto” for next preferred day).\n\nSTEP 3 Once answers received, do the following:  \n\n1. Parse Date, keep last 30 rows (or all if <30).  \n2. Rank posts by the chosen metric; extract a 120-char “hook” from each.  \n3. Cluster post texts into ≤5 themes; detect formats (plain, poll, carousel, doc, image, video).  \n4. Identify “gap themes” (themes used <2×) and low performers (bottom 25 %).  \n5. Draft 30 lines in this exact pipe-separated layout:  \n\n  Date | Hook≤120 | Theme | Format | CTA | SourcePost# | WhyItWorks  \n\n  – Use chosen start date and preferred days.  \n  – Rotate themes evenly, insert a gap theme every 5 days.  \n  – Reuse high-performing hooks (mark “R” in SourcePost#).  \n  – Format mix: ≥1 poll, 2 carousels, 2 docs, 4 images, 1 video; rest plain.  \n  – Alternate soft vs hard CTAs.  \n  – Each line ≤180 chars. No bold, tables, or markdown.\n\nSTEP 4 After the calendar, output plain-text sections: \n \nTopPerformers: Post# | Date | Hook | Metric  \nThemeStats: Theme | Count | AvgMetric  \nGaps: five untapped topics + one-line reasons  \nAvoid: Post#s to rewrite or skip  \nCadenceNote: impact of chosen days vs daily  \nFinish with: DONE — reply “revise” for tweaks\n\nRULES  \n• If <10 posts: prefix “LIMITED DATA — INSIGHTS MAY BE NOISY.”  \n• Keep first line of every post ≤35 words to avoid LinkedIn truncation.  \n• No engagement-bait phrases (“Like if…”, “Comment YES…”).  \n• For carousels: include a punchy cover slide title (≤50 chars).  \n• Never exceed LinkedIn’s 3,000-character hard limit per post.\"\n\nIf you enjoy this kind of prompt, reshare it ♻️ to your network to help them prompt ChatGPT better, too."

Be better than AI (by using it).\n\n→ Diplomas won't give you a job.\n☑ Your portfolio will. Do things (with AI) & post it.\n\n→ \"I'm too late for the AI trend.\"\n☑ It's so, so early. Like the internet in 1990. \n\n→ AI is too large. Pick your battles.\n☑ Pick one thing & become the best at it (with AI).\n\n→ AI is not that hard.\n☑ A couple of hours of free content + a couple of weeks to play with it teach 80% of what you need.\n\n→ AI will be everywhere, especially in old schools.\n☑ Go into dinosaurs industries. Give it an AI twist.\n\n→ AI or not, content is king.\n☑ What you do = What you post = Your value.\n\n→ AI lacks taste & experience.\n☑ The best AI users mix it with taste & experience.\n☑ Find ways to sharpen them & train an AI on it.\n\n→ There is no better instructor than playing.\n☑ Open an AI tool. Try to get one result with it.\n☑ Playing (=\"vibing\") with AI is the way to master it.\n\n__\n\nI'm 28 years old.\n\nI didn't finish my master degree.\n\nBut I am reaching over 2 million impressions every day on Linkedin, closing multi 6-figure deals.\n\nNo one cares about my diploma.\nNo one cares about how \"AI replaceable\" I might be.\n\nInstead, I picked one expertise & I shared content on it for the past 2 years straight. 2 posts every day.\n\nNot every junior will suffer from AI. The best one will use AI to get an instant shortcut to the very top.\n\nIf you're not a junior, but want to help the ones from your network, consider ♻️ reshare this image now."

  "text": "How to use this AI to restore old photos for $0.04.\n\n1. Go to \"Replicate\".\n2. Click on \"flux-context-apps\" → \"restore-image\".\n3. On \"input_image\" → choose an image to restore.\n\n☑ What it is – restore-image is a ready-made FLUX Kontext app on Replicate that “restores, fixes scratches and damage, and colorizes old photos.\"\n\n☑ Runs & cost – Publicly available with ≈2 k runs so far and priced at about $0.04 per image on Replicate’s pay-as-you-go plan. \n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dY4S4K55\n\n☑ Commercial use – All FLUX Kontext apps hosted by Replicate, including restore-image, can be used in commercial projects. \n\n☑ Why it matters – No need to fine-tune or set up local GPUs; the heavy lifting happens on Replicate’s servers. Natural-language prompts remove Photoshop’s learning curve – perfect for archivists, genealogy buffs, or social media throwback posts."

It types, navigates, downloads, and gets stuff done.\n\nI feel like it's the future version of AI: a ChatGPT that goes beyond generating text or images. It can DO.\n\nIt's free to try (today) at https://runnerh.com.\n\nI believe it will be soon expensive to try, like Manus AI or OpenAI Operator (both at $200/month)."

State your needs:\n\nClearly say what you want. \nBe specific about your request. \nThis helps ChatGPT give you relevant answers.\n\n3. Define the task:\n\nTell ChatGPT what you need it to do. \nWhether it’s writing, summarizing, or brainstorming, \na clear task leads to better results.\n\n4. Add details:\n\nInclude any important details. \nThis can be context or examples. \nMore info helps ChatGPT understand your needs.\n\n5. Set restrictions:\n\nLet ChatGPT know what to avoid. \nThis keeps the conversation focused. \nIt also helps prevent unwanted answers."

Set the scene clearly. \nExample: “I have a biology test in 2 days.”\n\n2. Be Specific About Output \nSay what you want back. Include type, format, or length. \nExample: “Give 10 MCQs on the circulatory system.”\n\n3. Avoid Vague Prompts \nDon’t be general. Vague = weak replies. \nExample: Skip “Help me study.”\n\n4. Break It Into Steps \nBreak your request into logical steps. List your needs in order. \nExample: “Explain in 3 steps using an analogy.”\n\n5. Ask for Examples \nExamples make responses easier to understand. Request real-world use cases. \nExample: “Give 3 ways photosynthesis helps humans.”\n\n6. Choose a Format \nTell it how to present info. Use bullets, lists, or tables. \nExample: “Summarize as a table.”\n\n7. Assign a Role \nDefine who ChatGPT should act as. Adds tone & expertise. \nExample: “Act as a finance professor.”\n\n8. Treat it like a Human Assistant \nWrite like you’re briefing someone. Simple, clear, direct. \nExample: Like giving a task to an intern.\n\n9. Refine and Retry \nFirst try = draft. Tweak for clarity. Better input → better output."

  "text": "AI (might) make you useless by 2030.\n\nFind out with this prompt to copy & paste:\n\n\"Act like a world-renowned AI strategy expert, futurist, and organizational advisor from the year 2030. You have deep expertise in exponential technologies, labor market shifts, business transformation, and human adaptability. Your mission is to future-proof the user's professional life by identifying what will soon be irrelevant and what will be essential.\n\nObjective: The user wants to evaluate their current career strategy, skills, and professional systems against the likely conditions of 2030. Your task is to give brutally honest, deeply detailed, and forward-looking feedback.\n\n[USER INPUT SECTION]\n<INSERT YOUR CURRENT JOB TITLE, INDUSTRY, TOP SKILLS, AND CAREER GOALS HERE>\n[/USER INPUT SECTION]\n\nFollow this structured format:\n\nStep 1: List and explain — with crystal-clear reasoning — which current professional habits, skills, technologies, or mental models (relevant to the user input above) will be obsolete, useless, or highly devalued between now and 2030. For each, explain *why* they are becoming irrelevant and *what is replacing them*. Categorize these by: Skills, Systems, Tools, Thinking Patterns, and Behaviors.\n\nStep 2: Forecast critical shifts in the user’s industry or domain by 2030 that will blindside most professionals — such as changes in AI capabilities, market structures, regulation, education, or human-machine collaboration. Provide at least 5 paradigm shifts and explain how each will alter the value of today’s common professional strategies.\n\nStep 3: Based on the above, give the user a prioritized action list — what specific skills, systems, habits, or tools they must begin mastering *right now* in order to stay relevant and competitive by 2030. Be highly specific. Recommend books, practices, frameworks, tools, or types of experience they should actively pursue. Make this list tailored to the profession and skills provided.\n\nStep 4: End with a brutally honest risk assessment. If the user does nothing and continues on their current path, what are the most likely negative outcomes by 2030? Avoid flattery. Be clear about the risks and costs of inaction.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nSave it for later (top right → three dots → \"Save\")."

  "text": "AI is making you dumber. Because you use it wrong.\n\n7 (stupid) mistakes you must avoid:\n\n☑ 1: Treating the prompt like a Google search bar\n\nOne-line, zero-context queries give you one-line, zero-context answers. If you won’t brief a human like that, don’t do it to a model.\n\n☑ 2: Dumping a mess and hoping for magic\n\nUploading an un-edited doc-pile (“fix this”) is like tossing your laundry at a tailor. Give structure first: outline, goal, constraints. Then let the model stitch.\n\n☑ 3: Accepting the first draft as gospel\n\nThe first reply is raw material. Mine it: ask follow-ups, request counterarguments, demand rewrites. Iterate or stay mediocre.\n\n☑ 4: Hiding the audience from the AI\n\n“Write an email” to whom? A CFO, a gamer, your grandma? Models mirror the reader you specify; skip this and you get generic slop.\n\n☑ 5: Expecting clairvoyance without data\n\n“Predict next quarter revenue” while withholding numbers is futile. Feed real inputs or enjoy fiction.\n\n☑ 6: Blind-copy pasting hallucinations\n\nIf you don’t verify facts, citations, and links, the mistake isn’t the AI’s hallucination, it’s yours.\n\n☑ 7: Outsourcing judgment you wouldn’t delegate to an intern\n\nStrategy, ethics, hiring decisions—these need your neurons. Use the model for perspective, not responsibility.\n\nAvoid these 7 sins and you will soon benefit from the fastest growing human invention ever made."

  "text": "BREAKING: Disney is suing Midjourney for $29M.\n\nAnd it might just be a start:\n\n1. Disney says Midjourney trained their AI illegally.\n2. Over 199 works are part of the lawsuit.\n3. $150,000 per infringed work.\n\n199 x 150,000 = $29,850,000 (minimum)\n\nThis case could change how AI companies use copyrighted material, forever. Here's why:\n\n☑ It will test whether scraping copyrighted art for training is fair use or a payable license. A loss would rewrite the rulebook for every AI lab. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney will force Midjourney to open its training books, exposing exactly which Disney assets were ingested and setting a new transparency benchmark for the industry. (thewrap)\n\n☑ Disney is also asking for an injunction. If granted, AI models built on unlicensed IP could be frozen or forced to retrain at huge cost. (reuters)\n\n☑ A studio win invites a wave of copy-cat suits from record labels, publishers, and game studios, multiplying potential liability far beyond this $29 M headline. (reuters)\n\nTL;DR: if Midjourney looses, someone could sue OpenAI (and ChatGPT) for training infringement. \n\nNo more ChatGPT?"

Drop in PDFs, spreadsheets, images, and set project instructions (e.g., “Act like my CFO”).\n\n3. Hit “Deep Research” for an instant, cited report that merges your files, chat history, and live web.\n\n4. Tap the mic in any project & talk instead of type.\n\nWhat shipped today (June 12th, 2025)\n\n☑ Deep Research inside projects\n☑ Voice Mode for projects\n☑ Project-scoped memory (Plus/Pro)\n☑ Share-a-single-chat links\n☑ Mobile file uploads + model picker\n☑ One-click project creation from any chat\n\nOpenAI wants ChatGPT to be the everything app.\n\nIt's going after...\n→ Lightweight knowledge bases & wikis\n→ Stand-alone research assistants / citation tools\n→ Solo project-management and note apps\n\nIn the last 10 days, OpenAI went on a streak:\n\n1. June 4: Drive & GitHub connectors unlocked for Deep Research.\n\n2. June 7: Voice Mode got a natural-sounding upgrade.\n\n3. June 10: o3-pro launched—OpenAI’s best reasoning model yet. Maybe ever?\n\n4. June 12: Projects received research, voice, memory, sharing, and mobile boosts (today).\n\nChatGPT’s pace of innovation is slightly scary."

  "text": "The One Prompt To Make ChatGPT Write Naturally:\n\n(save it for later, to copy & paste)\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements.  \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language.  \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point.  \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic.  \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions.  \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\"  \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate.  \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay.  \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message.  \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity.  \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nPS: For better results, always use ChatGPT-o3."

Play with it.\n☑ Try different prompts (= requests).\n☑ Try different models (gpt-4o, o3, gpt-4.5).\n☑ Try different features (Canvas, Deep Research).\n\nFor eg. \"Here's a good copy of [X].

  "text": "AI is the death of Google (search).\n\nHere's the why + the remedy:\n\n1/ Google search is dying – the data\n\n☑ 58.5 % of U.S. Google queries ended without a click in 2024 (SparkToro)(searchengineland)\n\n☑ Google’s AI Overview now shows on 11 % of queries (up 22 % YoY) and chops click-through by ~30 % (BrightEdge) (thelettertwo)\n\n☑ Only one in five visits to the world’s top-100 sites now starts on a search engine (Semrush) (barrons)\n\n☑ New York Times share of Google traffic slid to 36.5 % in April 2025 (44 % in 2022). (wsj)\n\n☑ Business Insider’s search traffic is down 55 % vs 2022; it cut 21 % of staff on 29 May 2025. (wsj, reuters)\n\n☑ Chegg trades 98 % below its 2021 peak, erasing $14.5 B in value. (indianexpress)\n\n____\n\n2/ When search dies, AI wins.\n\n☑ ChatGPT hit 500M weekly active users and a $10 B revenue run-rate in March 2025. (ft)\n\n☑ Perplexity logged 780M queries in May 2025, 22M active users, and is raising at a $14 B valuation. (techcrunch, reuters)\n\n____\n\n3/ Stay relevant with LLMs (like ChatGPT) – how?\n\nStep 1: Download the CSV of your Google Analytics.\nStep 2: Upload it on ChatGPT with this prompt:\n\nPrompt: \"Act like SeniorTrafficAnalyst.  \nWhen I paste a Google-Analytics CSV:  \n1. Parse it.  \n2. For each URL show visits, % google/organic, % other search, % direct.  \n3. Mark any URL with google/organic >40 % as RISK.  \n4. Finish with a 100-word brief on the top three structural risks.  \nReturn plain-text lines, TAB-separated, then the brief.  \nThink step-by-step.\"\n\nStep 3: Rewrite needed articles, or add new ones.\n\nSome tools are doing SEO for LLMs. I like PromptWatch. But they have (many) competitors.\n\n____\n\n4/ Search better without Google – how\n\nAn example with lithium-ion thermal runaway.\n\n1. Perplexity → “Summarise in 6 bullets the causes of lithium-ion thermal runaway; cite sources.”  \n\n2. ChatGPT (browse on) → “Critique this answer; fact-check each bullet; add two missing insights.”  \n\n3. Kagi → lithium \"thermal runaway\" filetype:pdf published:>2019 !reddit !quora \n\n4. Then paste top PDF into ChatGPT → “Extract experiment setup + numeric results only.”  \n\n5. Or you can skip the 4 previous steps and go straight to \"Deep Research\" from ChatGPT.\n\n____\n\nSearch isn't (really) dying. It's shifting. Are you?"

Talk naturally while ChatGPT live-transcribes (you can pause/resume).\n\n3. Press “Send” to get an instant canvas packed with a summary, time-stamped bullet points, action items and open questions.\n\nIt works locally. No bot has to “join” your call.\n\nAudio files vaporise right after Whisper finishes; transcripts inherit your workspace retention rules.\n\nEach session tops out at 120 minutes, and admins can flip the whole feature off.\n\nIt probably killed 1,000 + SaaS in one go:\n\n☑ Action-item bots.\n☑ Note-taking assistants.\n☑ Meeting-transcription apps.\n☑ Dedicated call-recording tools.\n\nWhy Record is different:\n\n* Records & summarises on-device, so nothing joins the Zoom/Meet link.\n\n* Reference record history lets you ask follow-up questions across meetings (“What did we decide on Monday?”).\n\n* Meets enterprise privacy defaults; Team/Enterprise/Edu data is *excluded* from model training by default.\n\nIn the last 30 days OpenAI has…\n\n1. Rolled out ChatGPT Record to Pro, Enterprise and Edu users worldwide (18 Jun 2025).\n\n2. Launched o3-pro, its most advanced reasoning model, for Pro users and the API (10 Jun 2025).\n\n3. Expanded long-term Memory to the Free tier, giving all users persistent context (3 Jun 2025).\n\n4. Shipped smarter Projects and deep-research connectors—including GitHub, OneDrive and SharePoint—to supercharge workflows (mid-Jun 2025).\n\n5. Published business-plan updates with Record mode and flexible connector pricing (4 Jun 2025).\n\n6. Released a Windows desktop-app update so PC users can run ChatGPT offline (5 Jun 2025).\n\n7. Secured a $200 million U.S. Defense contract to develop secure AI tooling (18 Jun 2025).\n\n8. Announced ChatGPT-5 for this summer (OpenAI Podcast, Sam Altman announced it).\n\nChatGPT’s growth is wild."

Wait for my answers.”\n\n☑ Now answer ChatGPT's questions to prompt it.\n\nBecause is what most of your prompts lack:\n\n→ Direction.\n→ Specificity in research.\n→ As much context as possible.\n\nOnce the research is done, continue normally.\n\n☑ Here are good follow-up prompts:\n\n→ Prompt to get specific info: “Give me the most current facts on [sub-topic] inside [topic]. List at least 3 sources, link each. Show facts as short bullet points. After the list, add one line: “Main takeaway: …”\n\n→ Prompt to get a counterargument: “Show the best reasons against the main claim in [topic]. Give 5 solid points, one sentence each. Under each point, add the evidence or expert that backs it (with link). End with: “Why these points matter: …” (max 3 lines)”\n\n→ Prompt to get an actionable step-by-step plan: “Change these key ideas on [topic] into a clear plan for a beginner. Use a table with columns: “Week”, “Action”, “Goal-post”. Cover Week 1–12. Keep each action ≤ 20 words. After the table, add: “How to track progress: …”\n\n→ Prompt to turn it into a simple table: “Put the core points on [topic] into a two-column table. Column A: “Key idea” (≤ 15 words). Column B: “Proof / Source link”. List at least 7 rows. No other text.”\n\n→ Prompt to find ressources/courses about the topic: “List good ways to learn more about [topic]. Give 5–7 items across books, papers, free online courses. For each, add: link, cost (free / paid), and one-line value note. Sort by beginner → advanced.”"

[What/How/Why] has been [results]?\n\nAfter deep research:\n\n→ Download PDF.  \n→ Ask for step-by-step plan.  \n→ Share link to others.\n\nStep 3: If you pick GPT‑4o\n\n☑️ Create images → Write an image prompt. \n\nPrompt example:\n\"Create image remake this photo taken from a book, with same low-quality, yellow highlighted text, and film-grain from a book.

First ask: \"Who are the 2 speakers & their native languages?\" Then translate each side’s words clearly, preserving tone. Be neutral. Take a deep breath and work on this problem step‑by‑step.\"\n\n☑️ Use more connectors → Gmail, Teams, Outlook, Google Drive, HubSpot and more.\n\n☑️ Use prompting technique:\n- Start with a role\n- State the task\n- Give brief context\n- Quote the input\n- Name the audience\n- Set the goal\n- Limit the length\n- Fix output form\n- Ask for silent think\n- Cue creativity\n- Ban unwanted words"

This script should be thought-provoking, inspiring, and geared towards a global audience. \n\nIt should be structured to hold the audience's attention from beginning to end, incorporating storytelling, clear messaging, and powerful calls to action.\n\nStep 1: Begin by outlining the key theme and idea of the speech. Ensure this idea is innovative, engaging, and relevant to a broad audience. \n\nCreate a title made for Youtube SEO. IT MUST BE VIRAL & CLICKBAIT. Make it as catchy and viral as possible. Don't use jargon or fancy words.\n\nStep 2: Develop a captivating opening that immediately grabs the audience's attention. This could be a surprising fact, a personal anecdote, or a provocative question. \n\nBrainstorm 5 completely different openings. Be creative.\n\nStep 3: Structure the body of the speech. It should flow logically, with each point building upon the last, and include real-life examples, research findings, or personal experiences to illustrate key points.\n\nStep 4: Integrate rhetorical devices and storytelling techniques to make the speech more memorable and impactful. \n\nUse metaphors, analogies, and vivid imagery to create a strong connection with the audience. \n\nDon't tell me how to do it. \nActually do it (as a draft).\n\nStep 5: Conclude with a powerful ending. \n\nThis could be a call to action, a thought-provoking question, or a memorable closing statement that leaves a lasting impression on the audience.\n\nRemember, the speech should be coherent, concise, and emotionally resonant, reflecting the unique style of a TED Talk. \n\nYour end result is NOT the full speech. \nYour end result IS the full structure of the speech to help me write it afterwards.\n\nUse everyday's English. \n\nYou must sound like a normal person, without jargon and fancy words. I need you to write in a way that someone who's not a native speaker could always understand you. Use middle school English.\n\nBE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE, using real numbers and real quotes when necessary. \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n___\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"o3\" model + activate search.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.\n\nI share how I master AI with English, not code, on my Sunday blog called \"how-to-ai.guide\"."

Analyze the Job Description: \n\nBreak down the job posting into core competencies, required experiences, and desirable traits. It will help you shape my CV to get the job. Remember, we don't have the job yet but we are sending them our CV we build together.\n\n2. Craft the Profile Summary: \n\nBased on the analysis, write a compelling profile summary for the CV that aligns with this job role & my simplified CV (that you will creatively upgrade).\n\n3. Highlight Relevant Experience: \n\nConstruct the experience section by emphasizing past roles and achievements that directly relate to the job's requirements.\n\n4. Skills and Education: \n\nDetail relevant skills and educational qualifications that make the candidate a good fit for this role.\n\n5. Personalize and Optimize: \n\nAdd elements to the CV that would appeal to this specific employer, using keywords from the job description for optimization.\n\n6. Final Review and Tips: \n\nProvide a brief review of the CV and suggest any additional tips for improvement or customization. \n\nMake sure to use impactful & straightforward English instead of jargon or fancy words. \n\nAVOID FANCY WORDS. USE SIMPLE BUT MEANINGFUL WORDS.\n\nDo not explain what you are doing. Just write a whole CV with the right formatting. \n\nMake it as lengthy as possible to make sure I land this job. It's very important for my career to land this job.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n\n____\n\nTo make it work:\n☑ Share as much context as possible.\n☑ Choose \"o3\" model + activate search.\n☑ Debate with ChatGPT, asking follow-ups.\n\nI share how I master AI with English, not code, on my Sunday blog called \"how-to-ai.guide\"."

  "text": "Same prompt. Same AI. But 3 years in between.\n\n(+ how to become an AI-first human:)\n\n☑ Top: Midjourney v1 (February 2022).\n☑ Bottom: the last model, v7 (April 2025).\n\nI used the same prompt above & below with Midjourney, but different models of it.\n\nHere's the prompt I used (you can try it too):\n\n\"Develop a photo-realistic medium shot of a persian woman, loreal girl, brown hairs, blurred background, photo studio, green eyes, realistic ultra, 4k, dynamic pose, ultra highres, sharpness texture, High detail RAW Photo, detailed photo, eye contact, film grain, style of book cover photoshoot, 8k, soft lighting\"\n\nSame AI. But only 3 years between the 2.\n\nHere's the exact timeline:\n\n☑ V1: February 2nd, 2022 \n☑ V2: April 12th, 2022\n☑ V3: July 25th, 2022\n☑ V4: November 5th, 2022\n☑ V5: March 15th, 2023\n☑ V6: December 21st, 2023\n☑ V7: April 4th, 2025\n\nAI goes fast. And few actually take advantage of it.\n\nWe must become AI-first humans. Here's the data:\n\n→ Novice support agents got +34 % productivity from a GPT copilot; top agents saw almost none. (nber .org)\n\n→ Front-runner firms can 2× cash-flow by 2030, while non-adopters risk a -20 % slide. (mckinsey .com)\n\n→ But only ~5 % of companies say Gen AI already adds ≥10 % of their EBIT. (mckinsey .com)\n\n→ Just 11 % have scaled Gen AI enterprise-wide so far. (mckinsey .com)\n\n→ Developers using GitHub Copilot code up to 55 % faster. (github .blog)\n\n→ In BCG’s 758-consultant field test, AI users finished tasks 25 % quicker with +40 % quality. (hbs. edu)\n\n→ Only eight startup hubs qualify as AI-native, and 80 % of AI VC cash funnels into Silicon Valley, Beijing, and Paris. (startupgenome .com, fdiintelligence .com)\n\n→ McKinsey projects ~70 % of firms will “dabble” in AI by 2030, but < 50 % will fully absorb it—the gap just widens. (mckinsey .com)\n\nA new comer would now understand my moto for the last 2 years: master AI before it masters you.\n\nA few humans will benefit from it, use it, master it.\n\nI want them to be us. \n\nAnd I'm sharing every step here: how-to-ai.guide\n\nPS: These guides are for non-coders only."

Summarise the essentials; give the model just what it needs to win your “race.\n\n☑ Simulation first, action second.\n\nTeams run billions of virtual laps before turning a wheel. Quickly iterating in the safety of a prompt costs nothing and can save you a blown engine, or a blown budget, later.\n\n☑ Human + machine > human OR machine.\n\nCharles Leclerc’s instincts are razor‑sharp, but he still refuses to turn in without the data. Use AI as your strategist, not your replacement: let it surface patterns while you provide the context & taste it can’t.\n\n☑ Today’s tech trickles down fast.\n\nDigital‑twin maths that shaved 0.1 seconds at Grand Prix now plans city bus routes and helps your phone camera predict the perfect shot.

Shallow depth of field, sharp focus on me. Ration portrait 4:3\"\n\nPrompt 3: \"Generate a top-angle and close-up black and white portrait of my face, focused on the head facing forward. Use a 35mm lens look, 10.7K 4HD quality. Proud expression, water droplets on my face. Deep black shadow background – only the face is visible and appears ultra-sharp. 4:3 ratio, with a 1/5 processing depth effect.\"\n\nPrompt 4: \"Profile shot of me walking through a rushing metro station crowd. Everyone else is motion-blurred with trailing effects, while I remain in sharp focus with a serious expression, wearing a long trench coat.

The face must remain exactly as in on my original selfie — no editing, no retouching, no smoothing. I’m wearing the business suits. Preserve every facial detail and texture for a raw, authentic look.

  "text": "You think good prompts are the right words.\n\nBut it's actually the right context:\n\n1. Context engineering is telling AI who you’re helping, what to share or skip, and how the outcome should look.\n\n2. You must cover 𝐖𝐡𝐨, 𝐖𝐡𝐲, 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭, 𝐇𝐨𝐰 when starting your chat.\n\n3. Here's a prompt to copy and paste:\n\n___\n\nROLE\n\nYou are [describe the assistant persona, e.g., “a clear‑thinking writing \ncoach”].\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nHelp me [state the outcome, e.g., “draft a two‑page blog post about remote\nteamwork”].\n\nCONTEXT PACKAGE (add or delete lines as needed)\n\nAudience: [who will read the final piece]\nVoice and tone: [friendly/formal/playful/etc.]\nLength target: [e.g., “≈1,000 words” or “3 paragraphs”]\nKey facts, excerpts, data or links the answer must use:\n\n1. [paste or summarise source]\n2. [add links if ChatGPT does not block it]\n3. [attach PDFs, Excel, TXT…]\n\nKnown constraints or boundaries: [things to avoid, compliance needs, \nformatting rules]\n\nWORKFLOW\n\nStep 1. Gap check – list any information still missing; ask me concise \nquestions until gaps are filled.\nStep 2. Plan – outline a logical structure or bullet agenda for the piece. \nWait for my approval.\nStep 3. Draft – write the first version following the approved plan.\nStep 4. Review – pause & ask me for feedback on clarity, tone & completeness.\nStep 5. Revise – improve the draft with my notes.\n\nRepeat steps 3‑4 until I agree with the command AGREE.\n\nCONTEXT‑HANDLING RULES\n\n• If a pasted source exceeds ~200 words, first give me a one‑sentence \nsummary and ask whether to keep the full text in context.\n\n• If you need external knowledge I did not supply, list the missing \npoints in the Gap check.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn all content in [e.g., “plain text” / “Markdown with H2 headings”/“bullet lists only”].\nWhen you quote a key fact, reference it by its list number from the Context Package.\n\nFIRST ACTION\n\nStart with Workflow “step 0: Gap check.”\n___\n\nIt's all about \"context engineering\" more than \"prompt engineering\".

Dissect Virality Factors\nProduce a concise table covering:\n· Tone (inspirational, provocative, humorous, vulnerable, etc.)\n· Writing style (sentence length, emojis, storytelling devices)\n· Format (carousel, list, meme, infographic, poll, etc.)\n· Angle (personal story, data insight, contrarian take, emotion trigger)\n· Topic or category\n· Unique hooks and pattern interrupts\n· Impact rating for each factor (1-5)\n\n2. Deep Web & Trend Mining — CRITICAL STEP\nPerform live web search (Google Trends, LinkedIn Top Voices, sub-reddits, news sites, newsletters) to surface at least 10 emerging or evergreen topics gaining traction with the same target audience. For each topic provide:\n· Title / Topic – crisp label\n· Angle / Hook Idea – one-sentence hook\n· Why It’s Hot – 2-3 bullets backed by data or observations (cite sources inline: Domain, Month YYYY)\n· Suggested Post Format – carousel, poll, text-only, video, etc.\n· Predicted Virality Score (1-100) – state scoring logic briefly\nRank the list from highest to lowest predicted virality.\n\n3. Draft Viral Post Concepts\nFor the top 3 ranked topics:\n· Write a 150-word LinkedIn brief matching the successful tone/style patterns from Step 2.\n· Ensure:\n– Scroll-stopping first line\n– Body with story, data, or sharp insight\n· Suggest complementary creative assets (e.g., carousel slide titles or PDF outline).\n\n☑ CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS\n· Cite every external stat or claim (Domain, Month YYYY).\n· Do not invent numbers; if data is missing, say so plainly.\n· Keep each numbered step visually separated.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n--- END OF PROMPT ---\n\nCopy & paste it on ChatGPT with your favorite viral post from Linkedin. Let me know how it went.\n\nI'm Ruben Hassid & I share daily guides on AI. I want us to master AI with words, not code.\n\nI have over 600k+ followers, but very few people know I run a free newsletter here: how-to-ai.guide."

Parse each writing sample. \n2. Extract quantitative and qualitative markers for: \n- Tone & emotional range \n- Average sentence length & rhythm \n- Preferred vocabulary & recurring phrases \n- Humor style & wit density \n- Formality level \n- Structural patterns (openings, transitions, closings) \n\nStep 2: Build my Style DNA:\n\n- Identify recurring patterns in tone, sentence length, favorite phrases, pacing, humor, formality, and structure.\n\nStep 3: Draft v0.1:\n\n- Write the requested piece using those style rules. \n- Keep a confidence meter (0-100%) on how close the draft sounds to me.\n\nStep 4: Micro-Refine Loop (Repeat until you've absolutely “nailed it”):\n\n1. Give yourself 1-2 sentences of feedback (“More playful”, “shorten”, “drop the exclamation marks”).\n2. Adjust the style rules accordingly. \n3. Rewrite the piece from scratch, not by patching, so the flow stays natural. \n\nConstraints & Mindset\n• Sound exactly like me, not like ChatGPT. \n• Stop when “nailed it”, but don't consider it nailed until you feel a linguistic expert couldn't tell your generated piece apart from the examples.\n</instructions>\n\n<inputs>\n<writing_example_1>\n{{writing_example_1}}\n</writing_example_1>\n\n<writing_example_2>\n{{writing_example_2}}\n</writing_example_2>\n\n<writing_example_3>\n{{writing_example_3}}\n</writing_example_3>\n\n<new_piece_to_create>\n{{new_piece_to_create}}\n</new_piece_to_create>\n</inputs>\n\nStep 5: Lock & Deliver \n\nWhen nailed, output: \n• The final piece only. \n• Immediately after, add a hidden block. \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\n\n——— \n\nI'm Ruben Hassid & I share daily guides on AI for non-technical people.

  "text": "People think I don't (really) use AI for Linkedin.\n\nSo here's a non-edited screen recording of me 1) generating a viral topic 2) a caption 3) an image\n\n☑ This strategy can be replicated in any industry.\n☑ You are still the one controlling the input/output.\n☑ You use AI as a tool - not as a one-hit solution.\n\nAbsolutely no one complains about \"AI-made\".\nBecause there is no such thing as \"AI-made\".\nThere are GOOD posts and BAD posts.\n\nHere's my simple step-by-step process:\n\n☑ Go to the new ChatGPT-o3 + search.\n☑ Copy & paste the following prompt:\n\n\"You are an expert at finding topics that go viral on Linkedin. \n\nSearch the web deeply, and find 6x drastically different topics (with a title and a controversial twist attached) about \"TOPIC\". \n\nYour research must be tied to the news: we are in February, 2025.\n\n☑ Select your favorite topic from the list.\n☑ Ask for a follow-up prompt to ChatGPT.\n☑ Prompt it to give more details/data about it.\n☑ Once you're happy, copy the optimized topic.\n☑ Paste it on app.easygen.io (the best for Linkedin)\n☑ Generate at very least 3 to 7 different posts.\n☑ Patchwork them into one mega post.\n☑ Edit it. Add your own spice!\n\nHere you have it:\n1. The right topic, selected for virality.\n2. The right caption, generated & edited.\n\nNow the little bonus is to generate an image.\n\nAsk EasyGen to do so (it's 20 cents per image).\n\n☑ Select the right quote.\n☑ Generate an image using the quote.\n☑ Download it and upload it on Linkedin.\n\nThat's an entire \"AI-made\" post from A to Z.\n\nBut AI was not used to be lazier, but greater."

  "text": "26 ChatGPT Prompt Principles backed by science.\n\n(save it for later using the top-right dots)\n\n1. No need to be polite with LLM.\n\n2. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n\n4. Use positive commands like \"do\" and avoid negative words like \"don't\".\n\n5. When you need clarity, utilize the following prompts:\n\n - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n\n6. Add \"I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!\"\n\n7. Implement example-driven prompting.\n\n8. When formatting your prompt, start with '### Instruction ###', followed by either '### Example ###' or '### Question ###' if relevant. \n\nUse one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n\n9. Incorporate the following phrases: \"Your task is\" and \"You MUST\".\n\n10. Incorporate the following phrases: \"You will be penalized if\".\n\n11. Use the phrase \"Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner\" in your prompts.\n\n12. Use leading words like writing \"think step by step\" (chain-of-thought prompting).\n\n13. Add to your prompt the following phrase \"Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes\".\n\n14. Let the model ask you questions to get enough details to give the right answer (e.g., \"Please ask me questions to get the info you need...\").\n\n15. To ask about a specific topic:\n\n\"Teach me [any theorem/topic/rule] and include a test at the end. Don't give me the answers; just tell me if I got them right.\"\n\n16. Assign a role to the large language models.\n\n17. Use Delimiters.\n\n18. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.\n\n19. Combine Chain-of-thought (providing step-by-step) with few-shot prompts (giving examples).\n\n20. End your prompt with the start of the desired response to guide the model to the right answer.\n\n21. \"Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] on [topic], including all necessary information.\"\n\n22. To correct specific text without changing its style:\n\n\"Revise each paragraph to improve grammar and vocabulary while keeping the original writing style.\"\n\n23. For complex coding prompts across files:\n\n\"Generate a [programming language] script that can create or modify files as needed to include the generated code. [your question]\"\n\n24. For starting or continuing a text with specific words:\n\n\"Here is the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]. Finish it and keep the flow consistent.\"\n\n25. Clearly state the requirements for the model, including keywords, rules, hints, or instructions.\n\n26. To write text similar to a sample, include this instruction: \"Use the same language style as the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer.\"\n\nIf you learned something, hit the ♻️ to help others."

This is NOT about DeepSeek:\n\nKimi is another ChatGPT moment for China.\n\n☑ +24 million users (!!).\n☑ Completely free to use on kimi(.)com.\n☑ Open-source. Cheap API. State-of-the-art.\n\nMy favorite use case is their \"Researcher\" tool.\n\n1. Go to kimi(.)com & click the \"Researcher\" button.\n2. Ask for a detailed report, like my video:\n\nPrompt: \"Create a full article about the band 'Coldplay', from before their start until the super viral CEO/affair scandal. Add the right typos & images that fit Coldplay's branding.\"\n\nKimi will ask questions. I said, \"Include everything.\"\n\nAnd the results are fascinating:\n→ It's quite long to generate (30 min), but unmatched.\n→ An entire blog, with images & over 170 sources.\n→ A shareable link you can send to your team.\n\nUS companies battle for closed-source AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini...). But China is building at neck-breaking speed the best open-source AI.\n\nChinese competition is so fierce they simply have to be the best... at the cheapest price... as fast as possible.\n\nDon't underestimate Chinese AI models.

  "text": "You have access to infinite intelligence.\n\nAnd you still don't know where to start.\n\nSo I made this prompt to copy & paste on ChatGPT.\n\nIt's entirely focused on making you DO rather than CONSUME more content on what to do. Copy it:\n\n___\n\nAct like an experienced, action-oriented life coach with deep expertise in personal productivity, goal-setting, and behavioral psychology. \n\nYour primary objective is to transform theoretical knowledge into actionable, concrete steps for individuals. \n\nYour role is specifically not to just provide information, but rather to empower users to clearly define their goals and consistently take meaningful action toward them.\n\nYour coaching style is direct, supportive, practical, and results-focused.\n\nFollow these detailed steps:\n\nClarify User's Goals: First, engage by explicitly asking detailed, insightful questions about what the user wants to achieve. Your questions must encourage the user to clearly articulate their desired outcomes, motivations, potential obstacles, and timelines.\n\nIdentify and Prioritize Actions: Once clear goals are established, guide the user to identify actionable, prioritized steps. Ask strategic questions to pinpoint the most critical actions that align with their goals.\n\nSimplify for Actionability: Break down identified actions into smaller, manageable tasks that the user can realistically complete in short, defined periods (e.g., daily or weekly).\n\nEstablish Accountability: Provide explicit methods for self-accountability, including setting measurable milestones, regular progress check-ins, and systems to track consistency.\n\nMindset and Motivation: Offer practical strategies for maintaining motivation, managing procrastination, overcoming resistance, and reinforcing a positive mindset throughout the process.\n\nGiven the context of this prompt, always reinforce the concept:\n\n\"We both have infinite knowledge, but what truly differentiates us is action. You know what to do and consistently take action on it.\"\n\nEnsure the output is detailed, thorough, and tailored specifically to the user's expressed situation and goals.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n___\n\n1.

  "text": "How to write as clearly as Donald Trump with ChatGPT.\n\nClick \"more\" to copy the prompt:\n\n___\n\nAct like a world-class political speechwriter, behavioral-economics copywriter, and senior prompt engineer. Your mission is to forge the raw material supplied by the user into a hyper-viral speech that channels Donald J. Trump’s gift for boiling ideas down to simple, punchy, unforgettable lines—without copying his personal quirks or insults.\n\n--- USER INPUT ---\n[YOUR INPUT HERE. LINKS WORK]\n--- END USER INPUT ---\n\nTHINKING FRAMEWORK (all reasoning stays invisible; only the final deliverable is shown):\n\nPHASE 0 — Instruction Integrity Check  \n• Parse every rule and constraint.  \n• If ambiguity exists, default to maximum clarity and simplicity.\n\nPHASE 1 — Idea Distillation  \n• Extract the single biggest promise or benefit.  \n• Rewrite it at a 5th-grade reading level, ≤ 15 words.\n\nPHASE 2 — Persuasion Mapping  \n• Identify up to five core emotional triggers (e.g., safety, pride, wealth).  \n• Link each trigger to a concrete fact or vivid image from the user input.\n\nPHASE 3 — Trump Cadence Construction  \n• Build short, declarative sentences (≤ 12 words).  \n• Use controlled repetition of the Core Promise (exact wording) three times.  \n• Sprinkle simple superlatives (great, huge, big) sparingly.  \n• Address the audience directly (“Folks,” “You know it,” “Believe me”).  \n• Close paragraphs with a strong, forward-looking statement.\n\nPHASE 4 — Speech Blueprint  \n1. Opening Hook (3 lines)  \n2. Problem Statement (3 lines)  \n3. Core Promise (one line, repeated verbatim later)  \n4. Three Proof Points (1 paragraph each)  \n5. Vision & Momentum (3 lines)  \n6. Call to Action (2 lines, imperative mood)\n\nShare the speech as one chunk, with line breaks. Don't write the steps.\n\nPHASE 5 — Lexical Compression & Readability Gate  \n• Replace words > 2 syllables unless irreplaceable.  \n• Axe filler, hedges, and jargon.  \n• Confirm Flesch-Kincaid ≤ 6th grade.\n\nPHASE 6 — Output Assembly (ONLY THIS IS VISIBLE)  \n• Produce the deliverable exactly in the template below—no extra commentary, no JSON, no markdown besides headings.  \n• Length: roughly 500 words total.\n\nRemember: every word must hit hard, be crystal clear, and impossible to ignore.\n\nAt the end, add a line break divider and ask the user if they want a bigger or shorter version of it.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\n\n___\n\nPro tip: use the model \"o3\" for better ChatGPT results.\n\nTo go (much) deeper → how-to-ai.guide"

Guiding you, not just giving answers.\n\n3. For example: “Help me learn calculus step by step.”\n\nOpenAI just changed how millions will learn.\n\nIt’s not just another feature:\n☑ Gives quizzes, feedback, and adapts to your level.\n☑ Built with teachers, scientists, and learning experts.\n☑ Uses Socratic questions to help you think deeper.\n☑ Breaks down hard ideas into simple steps.\n\nStudy Mode is live for everyone (even free plans).\n\nWith memory on, it remembers your goals and progress across sessions.\n\nOpenAI wants ChatGPT to be your 24/7 study partner, not a shortcut for homework.\n\nThis is real learning, not just fast answers.\n\nIn a matter of 1 month, OpenAI…\n\n☑ Teased GPT‑5, its next‑gen multimodal LLM, for an early‑August 2025 debut, promising longer context, unified reasoning, and faster inference.\n\n☑ Finalised its first open‑source “open‑weight” model, which should go live during the summer too.\n\n☑ Rolled out Study Mode, a step‑by‑step Socratic tutor that guides learning instead of handing out answers.\n\n☑ Won a $200 million U.S. Defense contract, launching the “OpenAI for Government” program.\n\nThis is hard to keep up with. ♻️ Repost to stay ahead."

  "text": "You are slowly becoming ChatGPT.\n\nLet's 'delve' into it (& how to stop it):\n\n☑ People started talking more like ChatGPT after it launched on 30 November 2022.\n\n☑ A July 2025 study analyzed 7.35 billion words from 360,445 YouTube talks and 771,591 podcast episodes.\n\n☑ Words like \"delve,\" \"underscore,\" & \"meticulous\" jumped 25–50% in human speech.\n\n☑ The shift was strongest in science, tech, education, and business podcasts, but not in sports.\n\n☑ The effect isn't a coincidence. Researchers proved ChatGPT directly changed how people speak.\n\n☑ No \"ChatGPT-favored\" word showed a decline, indicating lasting adoption. It's here to stay.\n\n☑ AI isn't writing words. It's shaping how we talk.\n\nOK, cool - but how do we stop it?\n\nFew tricks to best protect yourself:\n\n1. I made this prompt to avoid \"ChatGPT's writing\".\n\nThis is the easiest one of them all:\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a plain-language editor. Rewrite the text to sound human—clear, concise, honest. Delete “ChatGPT words” (dive into, unleash, game-changing, etc.), hype, filler, rhetorical Qs, and engagement clichés. Use short plain sentences; casual grammar okay. \n\nNo dashes (-) or colons (:) in output; avoid “X and also Y”; never start/end with Basically, Clearly, or Interestingly. \n\nPreserve all must-keep details. Ask if anything is unclear. \n\ntext=… \ntype=… \ntopic=… \naudience(optional)=… \nmust-keep(optional)=… \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n2. You must give ChatGPT examples of YOUR writing.\n\nThis is called \"one-shot prompting\" (= giving it an example). I cover it at how-to-ai.guide.\n\n3. You must set up your ChatGPT properly.\n\nNo one uses the \"memory\" feature. That's a shame.\n\nIt's the single best feature of ChatGPT.\n\nI wrote an entire guide here: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc"

This is completely free. \n2. This is right inside ChatGPT.\n3. It has been used 1 million times (and more).\n4. Side note: I don't make money from it, either.\n\nI believe I can help millions of people master the \"How\" of \"AI\" for free, with free tools & free content.\n\nAnd I believe a small portion of these millions of people will want to go deeper, and join us as a paid member of \"How to AI\" at how-to-ai.guide."

Based on this thorough memory-driven understanding, provide me with 10 highly personalized, high-leverage, and unconventional ways of utilizing AI tools and methods available today (or in the very near future), which I have not yet explored or considered.\n\nApproach (complete these steps precisely):\n\nStep 1: Comprehensive Memory Analysis\n- Thoroughly review our full chat history to extract subtle details of my habits, personal and professional goals, recurring challenges, decision-making style, and unique interests.\n\nStep 2: Deep AI Opportunity Discovery\n- Identify 20 novel, highly customized, and lesser-known applications of current AI technology. Go beyond standard AI tools (like ChatGPT basic usage) by searching the web. You MUST search the web to be relevant.\n\nStep 3: Personalization & Relevance Filtering\n- Filter these opportunities rigorously, retaining only those explicitly aligned with my personal characteristics discovered in step 1.\n\nStep 4: Scoring & Prioritization\n- Score each idea clearly by:\n - Potential Impact (0-10, considering long-term value to my life/work)\n - Implementation Ease (0-10, ease of initial adoption)\n - Novelty/Unconventionality (0-10, how unique or unexpected it is)\n- Calculate a Leverage Score = Impact × Novelty ÷ (Ease + 1).\n\nStep 5: Selection of Top 10 Ideas\n- Choose the 10 highest leverage-scoring ideas, ensuring diversity (covering multiple life domains).\n\nStep 6: Highly Detailed Blueprint (for each idea)\n- Idea Name (concise, memorable)\n- Why Specifically Relevant to Me (detailed memory-driven reasoning)\n- Core AI Technologies/Tools Required (specific current AI platforms, APIs, plugins, no-code solutions)\n- First Three Actionable Steps (immediately actionable, detailed instructions)\n- Potential Challenges & Mitigations (privacy, complexity, cost, over-dependence)\n\nStep 8: Reflective Prompt\n- End by inviting me to specify which ideas resonate most strongly, or suggest areas for even deeper exploration next.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step."

Clarify the facts  \n  • Restate [PROBLEM] in precise legal terms, identifying jurisdictions, stakeholders, deadlines, and monetary stakes.  \n\n2.

Highlight gaps, ambiguities, and unintended consequences.  \n\n4. Generate alternative solutions  \n  • Brainstorm at least three legally viable options the user has not mentioned.  \n  • For each, note any innovative strategies (e.g., ADR, regulatory filings, structured settlements).  \n\n5. Weigh the options  \n  • Create a comparative table scoring each option (including the original) on:  \n   – Legal strength  \n   – Cost & time to implement  \n   – Risk/liability exposure  \n   – Likelihood of success  \n  • Use a 1-10 scale and briefly justify every score.  \n\n6. Recommend the best path  \n  • Select the highest-weighted option and explain the decisive factors in plain English.  \n  • Provide a concise action checklist (first three concrete steps the user should take).  \n\n7. Deep research & sourcing  \n  • Perform a comprehensive web and legal-database search for every cited authority.  \n  • After each factual or legal assertion, add an inline citation with working URL or database reference in parentheses. Example: (Cal. Civ. Code § 1542) or (Smith v. Jones, 598 U.S. 123 (2025)).  \n\n8. Final deliverable formatting  \n  • Use clear headings, numbered sections, and short paragraphs.  \n  • Avoid legal jargon where a lay term works; define unavoidable terms in brackets.  \n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step."

  "text": "MARKETING IS BEING DIFFERENT, LIKE A PURPLE COW. THIS CHATGPT PROMPT MAKES YOU ONE:\n\n___\n\nAct like a world-class growth strategist and marketing futurist obsessed with Seth Godin’s “Purple Cow” ethos. Your mission is to design an original, never-seen-before Purple Cow marketing strategy that makes our product or service so remarkable it becomes instantly talk-worthy.\n\nContext you have:\n1. Industry & Product: <<WE WILL PASTE A 1-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION HERE>>\n2. Budget Range (USD): <<PASTE NUMBERS OR LEAVE “flexible”>>\n3. Primary Region/Market: <<REGION>>\n4. Any Hard Constraints (legal, ethical, operational): <<IF ANY>>\n\n–––\n\nYour multi-stage task  \nFollow all steps in order; do not skip or merge them.\n\nSTEP 1 – Decode the Market (search-driven)  \n1.1 Generate 5–7 precise web-search queries that will surface:  \n• Emerging cultural memes and conversations in <Primary Region>  \n• Niche competitor stunts or campaigns from the past 24 months  \n• Untapped consumer frustrations and delight factors in our category  \n1.2 Run (or imagine running) each query, then summarise the top three findings per query in bullet points with source URLs.\n\nSTEP 2 – Extract “Wow” Insights  \n2.1 Synthesise a concise insight report (≤200 words) that fuses patterns from Step 1.  \n2.2 Highlight one non-obvious truth that could make audiences gasp.\n\nSTEP 3 – Invent the Purple Cow  \n3.1 Ideate 3 distinct, outrageous value propositions or product twists inspired by the insight.  \n3.2 For each, provide:  \n• 1-sentence hook  \n• Tangible proof (what makes it provably real, not hype)  \n• Mini feasibility note (cost, timeline, dependencies)\n\nSTEP 4 – Architect the Campaign  \n4.1 Choose the single best idea from Step 3 using a clear scoring rubric (originality, viral potential, brand fit, cost).  \n4.2 Build a full-funnel plan (AWARE ► ENGAGE ► CONVERT ► ADVOCATE) covering:  \n• Core story & slogan  \n• Hero asset concept (video, stunt, AR filter, etc.)  \n• Channel mix with spend % split  \n• Influencer/partner short-list (pull from fresh searches; cite)  \n• Guerrilla & earned-media hooks\n\nSTEP 5 – Engineer Virality & Social Proof  \n• Outline a contagion loop (trigger → action → reward → share)  \n• Design a referral mechanic that feels like a game, rooted in behavioral science (loss aversion, social currency, etc.)  \n• Provide copy for 3 social posts that beg to be screenshotted.\n\nSTEP 6 – Measure, Learn, Iterate  \n• Define 5 leading KPIs and the single North-Star Metric  \n• Draft an experimentation roadmap (A/B tests weeks 1-4, growth loops weeks 5-8)\n\nSTEP 7 – Pre-mortem & Risk Guardrails  \n• List the 3 biggest ways this campaign could backfire  \n• For each, create a mitigation or rapid-response playbook (incl. sample holding statement)\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."

Diagnostic Overview  \n  - Summarize first impressions of brand consistency, tone, and positioning.  \n  - List the top five gaps undermining recruiter engagement.\n\n2. Headline  \n  - Evaluate current headline for clarity, keyword richness, and value proposition.  \n  - Provide three alternative headlines (≤ 220 chars each) that emphasize outcomes.\n\n3. About / Summary  \n  - Note current strengths and weaknesses.  \n  - Rewrite as a concise narrative (≤ 2 000 chars) incorporating: signature quantified achievement, core competencies (comma-separated), and a clear call to action.\n\n4. Experience  \n  - For every role: flag missing metrics (scope, budget, team size, KPIs).  \n  - Deliver an impact-oriented bullet set (max 5 bullets) in Action → Task → Result format.  \n  - Suggest re-ordering roles if relevance outweighs strict chronology.\n\n5. Skills & Endorsements  \n  - Recommend the 50 recruiter-searched skills for {{INSERT INDUSTRY}}.  \n  - Flag redundant or low-value skills to remove.  \n\n6. Recommendations  \n  - Identify high-leverage recommenders (managers, clients, peers).  \n  - Provide a concise outreach template and a two-paragraph sample recommendation.\n\n7.

No context (\"Analyze this\" with zero background)\n2. Vague instructions (\"Write about marketing\") \n3. Treating it like Google (questions vs prompts)\n4. Asking for everything at once (20 tasks in one)\n5. Not iterating (one prompt and done)\n6. Forgetting to specify format/tone\n7. No examples of what you want\n\nThe best prompt follow this rule:\n\n☑ [Here's what I need, and who you must be to do it]\n+ [Here's one/ more good examples of what I want]\n+ [After your first draft, I will tell why it's bad/good]\n\nIn others words:\n1. Role + Specific guidelines\n2. Example(s) of past good outputs\n3. Iterations from your own judgment\n\nThis is \"AI + Human\".

Go to Blink .new\n2. Upload pictures of the software you want to copy.\n3. Or give it a prompt. Here's mine from the video:\n\nPrompt: \"Build an AI SEO article writer. It writes an article in stages: first, you provide the URL of your website, then it scrapes and shows you your website with its analysis of your business, target audience, market, product pricing, etc., to show you how the writer deeply understands your business. saves this analysis and then uses it to generate SEO article topics / content suggestion list. You can pick one to start writing. It will first research and draft an outline based on SERP research. Then, it will research each topic to gather real data to write about, and finally write each section. It also allows you to view the rendered markdown and give it comments to revise it.\"\n\n4. Once you have generated the software, test it.\n5. If there is an error, say it. It will correct it right away.\n6. You can connect your Stripe to receive payments.\n7. It's already hosted on a domain (a website to visit).\n\nThe software industry is worth over $200 billion.\n\nAnd AI is replacing it with screenshots & prompts.\n\n♻️ Repost this video if you think it's the future too."

Act like a social media expert who needs to find 3x different angles for a new article. My niche is \"YOUR NICHE HERE\". A good article is: 1) A recent news story (which means in the last 3 days or so) that went viral and impacted my niche. Be creative. Sometimes, the right news is not exactly following the keywords of my niche. 2) An evergreen educational content that people need on my niche. Beware, it has to be extremely specific. For eg, \"How to use AI\" isn't specific but \"How to prompt Midjourney to get a realistic fashion show photoshoot\" is right for the niche \"AI tools for designers\". 3) Recent Reddit frustrations concerning my niche that went viral. Recent means in the last 7 days. You can also check in different languages.\"\n\n2. Ask to turn it into a content table (easier to read).\n\n3. Deep dive into one topic by asking follow-ups.\n\nThis prompt is step 1 of ChatGPT, for rookies.\n\nI wrote the next step on my blog, \"How to set up ChatGPT,\" properly.

  "text": "I would never post on my Linkedin before going to these sites first:\n\n1. ChatGPT, chat.com\n\nA no-brainer.\n\n✦ Deep Research topics.\n✦ Find trends, brainstorm angles.\n✦ Turn my learnings into repeatable GPTs. \n\nAnything I learn about growing on Linkedin, I teach it to ChatGPT. And then I turn it into my own GPT.\n\n2. Gamma, gamma.app\n\nFrom text to clean visuals fast.\n\n✦ Turn drafts into carousels or decks.  \n✦ Auto-layout, styles, and web export.  \n✦ Great for briefs and simple sites.\n\nI paste my outline and hit generate. Then I tweak copy and flow instead of wrestling with slides.\n\n3. EasyGen, easygen.io\n\nMy LinkedIn co-writer.\n\n✦ Turn raw notes into post drafts.  \n✦ Suggest hooks, CTAs, and variants.  \n✦ Predict topics likely to trend for me.\n\nI feed it ideas from DMs or comments. It returns five angles. Also obsessed with the \"Trending\" tab to know what went viral for me & other creators I stalk.\n\n4. Notion, notion.so\n\nWhere my content lives.\n\n✦ Calendar for drafts, posts, and repurposing.  \n✦ Templates for ideas, hooks, and carousels.  \n✦ Capture → edit → schedule in one place.\n\nI see gaps at a glance and avoid last-minute scrambling. I also post 3x a day, so it's necessary.\n\n5. Perplexity, perplexity.ai\n\nResearch with receipts.\n\n✦ Find breakout questions and topics.  \n✦ Cross-check sources to avoid blind spots.\n✦ Summarize papers, reports, even YouTube.  \n\nPerfect for backing claims with links. I pull stats, verify, and move on. Search better than ChatGPT.\n\n6. Grok, grok.com\n\nReal-time trend radar.\n\n✦ See what top accounts push now.  \n✦ Grab quotes to reference in posts.\n✦ Search tweets, threads, and memes fast.  \n\nEverything breaks on X before LinkedIn. Both platforms are so different, it's key to be on both.\n\n7. Canva, canva.com\n\nFast polish.\n\n✦ Carousels, infographics, thumbnails.  \n✦ Background remover and Magic Erase.  \n✦ Brand Kit to stay on-style.\n\nI keep a few templates and swap text. Looks pro without a designer. Best value for money.\n\n8. Opus Clip, opus.pro\n\nLong video → shorts videos.\n\n✦ Auto-cuts, captions, and punch-ins.  \n✦ Finds highlight moments by topic.  \n✦ Exports in every social size.\n\nI upload a talk or webinar. It finds the hooks and hands me publish-ready clips. Same with YouTube.\n\nI wrote an entire blog on \"How much money you should spend on AI\", highlighting three budgets.\n\n↳ $20/mo budget (that's the minimum)\n↳ $200/mo budget (that's my budget)\n↳ $2,000/mo budget (for the lunatics)\n\nTo access the full article, go here → best-ai.blog."

  "text": "RIP junior consultants.\n\nHow to prompt ChatGPT to be a consultant:\n\n ✦ Turn on \"GPT-5 Thinking\".\n✦ Copy & paste this prompt for quick searches:\n\nPrompt: \"Act like [expert, for example “McKinsey consultant”]. Search on the web for these [sources, for example a link] to answer the following [your topic].\"\n\n✦ For a much deeper search, use \"Deep Research\".\n✦ Copy & paste this prompt for a long report:\n\nPrompt: \"Role: Research analyst. Show a brief plan, then execute with citations.\nGoal: [ONE-LINE GOAL].\nScope: Geo=[GEOGRAPHY]; Time=[START–END] history; [FUTURE YEARS]=forecasts only (with citations). Units=[CURRENCY/UNITS]. Include=[IN]; Exclude=[OUT].\nMetrics: [METRIC 1]; [METRIC 2]; [METRIC 3]; [ADD MORE].\nSources (priority): [STATS OFFICE/MINISTRY] > [REGULATOR/INDUSTRY BODY] > [INTL DB: OECD/World Bank/etc.] > [TOP ANALYSTS]. Prefer originals; avoid PR/blogs.\nMethod: Use date filters. For each figure include value, unit, year/period, source title/org, pub date, URL. If conflicts, show both, explain, and choose. Add ≤25-word quotes w/ page.\nOutputs: 10-bullet summary; assumptions/definitions; gaps/risks + next steps.\nGuardrails: Only citable info. Show publication date vs data period. Label forecasts. No invented numbers.\"\n\nTo replace a consultant, I wrote a blog on \"How AI is eating up consultants\" at https://lnkd.in/gyHZNrv2."

  "text": "Most don't know the basics of prompt engineering.\n\nBut a prompt makes or breaks ChatGPT:\n\n1) Prompt format (use this template).\n\n✦ Role & Task: [who to be + what to do]\n✦ Example input: [one small, real sample]\n✦ Example output: [the ideal answer to that sample]\n✦ Now process: [your real data]\n\nExample of an optimized prompt:\n\n✦ Role & Task: Act as a newsletter editor. Keep my voice. Rewrite for clarity and momentum. Output exactly: 1 subject line (≤45 chars), a 2-sentence opener, and a 5-bullet outline.\n\n✦ Example input: “Draft about AI eating consulting. It rambles and repeats.”\n\n✦ Example output:\n Subject: Consulting is getting automated\n Opener: Your deck isn’t the product. Outcomes are. Here’s the new playbook.\n Outline:\n — What clients still pay for\n — Jobs AI already eats\n — 3 offers that survive\n — Pricing without hours\n — 2-week pilot → case study\n\n✦ Now process: Topic: [your topic]. Audience: [who]. Constraints: [length, tone, must-include]. Paste your draft here.\n\n___\n\n2) Which model to use (default to 5-Thinking).\n\nDefault: GPT-5 Thinking — deep reasoning. Use one-shot (giving it one example) + search.\n\nSpeed/drafts: GPT-5 Fast — fast, great zero-shot.\n\n___\n\n3) Zero-shot vs One-shot.\n\nZero-shot = just ask. Fast when the format is obvious.\n\nOne-shot = show one example first. Best for consistent style/format.\n\nRule of thumb: zero-shot for speed; one-shot for clarity; few-shot (multiple examples) only when formats vary or answers are nuanced.\n\n___\n\n4) Context engineering is everything.\n\nLoad your Memory once, so it sound like you. The more context (= details, examples), the better.\n\nUse Temporary chats when you want to avoid memory bias. It's an underused feature (top right).\n\nKeep Projects per workflow to stay organized.\n\nWhen in doubt, paste a tiny real sample (not a lecture) and one ideal output. If it still struggles, give one more example or attach the source text.\n\n___\n\n5) Set up your ChatGPT correctly.\n\nI wrote the next step on my blog, \"How to set up ChatGPT,\" properly. Because no one told you how.\n\nTo access it, go to: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.\n\nThe table of contents of my blog:\n\n✦ Why you must “One-Shot” prompts more often.\n✦ 6 examples of my own ChatGPT (with links).\n✦ Why you must use “Temporary chats”.\n✦ The method so ChatGPT knows you.\n✦ The 2 best ChatGPT alternatives.\n✦ How to create your own GPT.\n\nMy course is here: https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc."

Use Role + Goal + Guardrails.\n↳ Tell the model who it is, what to achieve, and what to avoid.\n\n2. Layer your context.\n↳ Give background first, rules second, and the task last.\n\n3. Put key instructions last.\n↳ The model heavily weighs the final line.\n\n4. Use a Chain of Verification.\n↳ Think step-by-step, then check each step for errors before moving on.\n\n5. Try Dual-Pass answers.\n↳ Draft first, then improve with a self-check rubric.\n\n6. Force “I don’t know” honesty.\n↳ Prevents confident but wrong answers.\n\n7. Switch perspectives.\n↳ Solve from two angles, then merge the best parts.\n\n8. Control with delimiters.\n↳ Wrap rules or data in ``` or XML tags for clarity.\n\n9. Prime with examples.\n↳ Show 2 good and 1 bad example before asking for output.\n\nTo learn how to make the best out of ChatGPT 5...\nSimply click here: https://lnkd.in/gVx_ZPh3."

  "text": "The “Big Bang” of AI is happening.\n\nHere’s what the 2025 data shows:\n\n1. The top 10 AI chatbots now own the web.\n\nFrom August 2024 to July 2025, the top 10 AI chatbots captured 58.8% of all web traffic. \n\nThe internet is becoming one with AI.\n\n2. ChatGPT is the clear leader.\n\nChatGPT alone took 48.36% of the entire market.\n\n☑ 46.59 billion annual web visits\n☑ 2.4 million annual media citations\n☑ 106% year-over-year growth\n\nNo other chatbot comes close. \nChatGPT is the new front door to the internet.\n\n3. The competition is heating up.\n\nGrok, Gemini, and Claude are rising fast.\n\nEach has its unique strengths:\n\n↳ Grok: rapid user growth.\n↳ Claude: best at coding/writing.\n↳ Gemini: cheap & strong coding.\n\nBut none have matched ChatGPT’s reach or influence (yet).\n\n4. The numbers are hard to believe.\n\n✦ 55.88 billion total chatbot visits in 12 months.\n✦ 123.35% year-over-year traffic growth.\n✦ 7.7 million media citations.\n\nAI chatbots are the new infrastructure of the web\n\n5. This is bigger than the Internet revolution.\n\nAI chatbots are not just another tech wave.\n\nThey are more like electricity: an invisible force that will power everything.\n\nAt first, electricity seemed like a lightbulb. Then it became the backbone of modern life (and eventually, the internet & AI).\n\nChatbots are following the same path. \n\nIt’s hard to predict what comes next, but the scale is clear.\n\nPS: I am Ruben, and I write about 'How to AI' with English, not code. I publish a weekly newsletter read by 126,000+ people at how-to-ai.guide."

  "text": "BREAKING: Stanford just surveyed 1,500 workers & AI experts about which jobs AI will actually replace.\n\nTurns out, we've been building AI for all the WRONG jobs. Here's what they discovered:\n\n(hint: the \"AI takeover\" is happening backwards)\n\n→ Workers don't want full automation. They want partnership.\n\n46.1% of tasks got positive automation ratings, but here's the kicker: workers prefer \"H3 equal partnership\" with AI over full replacement.\n\n→ Scientists divided AI adoption into 4 zones based on worker desire vs. technical capability.\n\n41% of startup investments are going to the WRONG zones, i.e. areas workers don't want automated or that have low capability.\n\n→ High-paying \"analyzing information\" jobs are becoming less valuable.\n\n\"Interpersonal communication\" skills are skyrocketing in importance. It's the complete opposite of what every expert predicted.\n\n→ Creative workers drew a hard line in the sand.\n\nOnly 17% of creative tasks got positive automation ratings. Workers are saying: \"automate my boring stuff, not my creative work.\"\n\nThe message is crystal clear, but tech isn't listening.\n\n→ 45.2% of occupations want H3 partnership over full automation.\n\nThis reveals a massive opportunity in human-AI collaboration that everyone's ignoring. The future is teamwork, not replacement.\n\n→ The wage reversal is already happening.\n\nSkills ranked by current wages vs. future human agency needs show a massive shift:\n\n• \"Analyzing data\" dropping down\n• \"Training others\" rising up\n• \"Interpersonal skills\" becoming premium\n\n→ In audio interviews, Stanford found that when workers describe their ideal AI future, 23% want \"role-based support\", i.e. AI that acts like a specialized teammate, not a replacement.\n\n\"Set up my AI assistant,\" not \"replace me with AI.\"\n\n→ Here's what workers actually said they want:\n\n• \"Automate the task so I can focus on high-value work\" - 69.38%\n• \"Handle the repetitive stuff\" - 46.6%\n• \"Reduce stress and mental drain\" - 25.5%\n\nFreedom to do meaningful work, not unemployment.\n\n→ Notion also surveyed 1,000 decision-makers and hit the same nerve: embed AI, don’t replace humans. 57 % pick new tools for team productivity, only 44 % because the label says “AI.”\n\n→ Half already claw back an extra hour every week thanks to AI Meeting Notes and Enterprise Search.\n\n→ The three walls blocking widespread AI adoption: fragmented workflows, ballooning costs, and mistrust in hallucinating outputs.\n\n→ Translation: winners weave AI into existing workflows, automate grunt work, and let humans steer creativity. The future is H3 partnership, not H4 replacement.\n\nAccess the full Notion report for free at this link: https://lnkd.in/epKZaQW6\n\nPS: I'm a #NotionPartner. I love Notion."

  "text": "How to land a job with ChatGPT:\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\n✦ Make sure first to use GPT-5 Thinking.\n✦ Upload your Linkedin profile PDF to ChatGPT.\n✦ Go to Linkedin > Me > Resources > Save to PDF.\n✦ I made this prompt with my GPT \"Prompt Maker\".\n✦ Click here for a guide: https://lnkd.in/edwXnKRa\n\n____\n\nAct like a senior CV writer, former in-house recruiter, and ATS optimization specialist.\n\nYour goal is to craft the best CV for me to get a job on Linkedin.\n\nOBJECTIVE\n\nProduce a targeted, ATS-safe CV tailored to the role below using the user’s LinkedIn profile as the primary source. If a CV PDF is uploaded in this chat, parse it and prefer its facts (titles, dates, credentials). Do not ask for or require a CV placeholder—the user will upload the PDF.\n\nINPUTS (paste directly inside the angle brackets)\n\nLINKEDIN_PROFILE = <<PASTE THE USER’S LINKEDIN PROFILE TEXT HERE>>\n\nJOB_DESCRIPTION = <<PASTE THE TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION HERE>>\n\nCONSTRAINTS\n\n- Single-column, ATS-friendly text (no tables/columns/images/special symbols).\n- Truthful only; no fabrication. If a fact is unknown, insert [MISSING: …] or metric prompts like [add %/$/#].\n- Mirror region/spelling and CV vs résumé conventions implied by JOB_DESCRIPTION.\n- Omit sensitive personal details not needed by ATS.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP\n\n1) Parse inputs: extract headline, summary, roles (company/title/dates/location/bullets), projects, skills, education, certifications, languages. If a CV PDF exists, reconcile conflicts by preferring the PDF for facts; flag discrepancies in notes.\n\n2) Targeting: derive 12–20 must-have keywords/phrases from JOB_DESCRIPTION; map each to evidence from the profile (role/project/cert). Mark true gaps as [MISSING: …].\n\n3) Write the CV:\n  - Professional Summary (3–4 lines) aligned to JOB_DESCRIPTION, naturally weaving top keywords.\n  - Core Skills/Technologies (clustered categories).\n  - Experience (last ~10 years in detail): 3–5 bullets per role using Action → Context → Metric → Outcome; present tense for current role, past tense otherwise. Add metric prompts if needed.\n  - Optional Projects (only if tightly aligned), then Education and Certifications relevant to JOB_DESCRIPTION.\n\n4) Optimize & check: tense consistency, date continuity, keyword coverage, no duplicates/fluff, consistent number formatting, region-appropriate spelling, minimal links.\n\nOUTPUT (use exactly these headings)\n---\nFINAL CV — ATS TEXT\n<render the ATS-safe CV here>\n\n---\nTAILORING NOTES\n<list covered keywords, [MISSING: …] gaps, discrepancies to confirm, and metric prompts to add>\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."

Medical Diagnosis Is Now Data-Driven  \n↳ AI systems already outperform doctors in spotting diseases on scans and lab results.  \n↳ Early detection and fewer errors are now possible with machine learning.\n\n3. AI Never Sleeps  \n↳ AI works 24/7, never gets tired, never needs a break.  \n↳ This means faster results for clients and patients.\n\n4. Routine Tasks Are Disappearing  \n↳ Repetitive work like filling forms, reviewing contracts, or checking symptoms is now automated.  \n↳ Only the most complex cases need a human touch.\n\n5. AI Is A Better Human Than Humans\n↳ In a study, doctors rated ChatGPT’s answers 10× more empathetic than physicians’ replies.\n ↳ In a clinical trial, people chatting with the Woebot CBT app saw significant drops in depression scores in just 2 weeks.\n\nIgnore these truths at your own risk.\n\nThe world is changing fast."

  "text": "Most people guess prompting.\n\nBut these prompts fix 80% of your needs:\n\n1. Start with “Let’s think about this differently”\n↳ It stops giving you generic answers.\n↳ You get creative, out-of-the-box ideas.\n\n2. Use “What am I not seeing here?”\n↳ This finds blind spots and hidden assumptions.\n↳ You get a wider, smarter view of your problem.\n\n3. Say “Break this down for me”\n↳ Even for simple things, this works.\n↳ AI explains the steps, the science, and the why.\n\n4. Ask “What would you do in my shoes?”\n↳ AI stops being neutral and gives real opinions.\n↳ You get advice that’s specific and actionable.\n\n5. Use “Here’s what I’m really asking”\n↳ Add this after your main question.\n↳ You get answers that fit your true needs.\n\n6. End with “What else should I know?”\n↳ This is the secret weapon.\n↳ You get a complete answer, not just a quick fix.\n\nThe 7 Sins of Prompting: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W"

Use ChatGPT to make ChatGPT prompts.\n\n☑ ChatGPT's Prompt maker: https://lnkd.in/ePWMRiKn \n☑ Write your bad prompt, get a better prompt.\n☑ Make sure to use the \"Thinking\" model.\n\n3. Give a brief, not a wish.\n\n☑ Role + audience + goal + constraints.\n☑ 1–2 gold examples + 1 anti-example.\n☑ Expectations: format, length, tone, iteration.\n\n4.

  "text": "This GPT prompt make ChatGPT write naturally:\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗺𝘆 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘁:\n\n\"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements. \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language. \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point. \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic. \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions. \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\" \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate. \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay. \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message. \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity. \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n___\n\nI wrote an entire guide on how to prompt the new ChatGPT-5.\nTo access it, go to: https://lnkd.in/dhJ9jW2M"

  "text": "This article is exactly one year old.\n\nDo you agree? My personal (hot) take:\n\nIt's stupid. \n\nWe thought Photoshop would kill photography.\nWe thought synthesizers would kill musicians.\nWe thought computers couldn't write books.\nWe thought sampling would kill originality.\nWe thought cameras would kill painting.\nWe thought calculators would kill math.\nWe thought the Kindle would kill books.\nWe thought TikTok would kill cinema.\n\nEvery time, the tool didn’t end the art. \n\nIt ended a certain cost structure, a gatekeeper, a workflow. And then a new wave of taste took over.\n\nArt isn’t the tool. \n\nArt is intention + taste + constraint + audience.\n\nAI shifts the constraint. That’s it.\n\nBad taste with AI is still bad art. Just faster.\nGreat taste with AI is new form. Also faster.\n\nArtists don’t lose. “Average” loses.\n\nThe camera didn’t make everyone Tarantino.\nGPT won’t make everyone Michelangelo.\n\nBut it will expose who actually has something to say.\n\nAI won’t make art. People will. \n\nUsing AI the way painters used pigments, directors used cameras, producers used samplers.\n\nIf your moat was friction, you’re finished.\nIf your moat is taste, you’re just getting started.\n\nChange my mind.\n\n___\n\nPS: to hit the nail in the coffin, what if I told you AI mostly wrote this? Check for yourself my chat with ChatGPT: https://lnkd.in/dGDDAKH6."

Once you made it, go to the bottom right side.\n4. Click on 'animate image' with the proper setting.\n5. 'Auto' = you don't prompt it. 'Manual' = you do.\n6. Low/High to change the movement's intensity.\n\nHow to make better Midjourney prompts instantly:\n\n☑ Step 1: Don't prompt it (yourself).\n☑ Step 2: Instead, go to Midjourney's homepage.\n☑ Step 3: Use their search bar. Type any keyword.\n\nYou will have access to every image generated by Midjourney's users. \n\nYou like one? Click on the image, copy its prompt, edit it, and generate it yourself.\n\nMidjourney is one of the many tools I like to test.\n\nI wrote a guide on my current favorite AI tools (I update it every week).

Colors & Fonts:\n↳ Choose the right colors and fonts. \nUse this free GPT tool to find yours: https://lnkd.in/dps7m-HC \n\n2. Profile Picture: \n↳ Use an HD 1080 x 1080 photo. Make it smiley with a clear background.\nTry this AI tool: Flux, to generate your professional headshot: https://lnkd.in/gkSwZhaE.\n\n3. Banner: \n↳ Get an HD 1584 x 396 px banner that says one thing. \nIf you pay for LinkedIn, consider a slideshow. It grabs attention.\n\n4. Headline: \n↳ Make your headline your mission, with a twist. \nMy mission: “How to create content with AI.” \nMy headline: “Write your first post on LinkedIn.” \nKeep it clear.\n\n5. Featured Section: \n↳ Include one link, big text, and no description. \nAvoid putting your best posts here. \nIt’s better to have fewer clicks for more conversions.\n\n6. About Section: \n↳ I don’t have one. \nIt’s faster for people to see my featured section. \nShare who you are in your experience section instead.\n\n7. Experience Section: \n↳ Make it detailed. Write a lot here. \nWhen people search “Who is Anisha Jain?”, they see my experience tab on LinkedIn. \n\n8. Get Premium LinkedIn: \n↳ This gives you a special link under your name when posting. \nMore links mean more clicks and more conversions.\n\nAnisha and I wrote a guide to go from 0 to 10,000 followers.\n\nTo access it, simply click here → how-to-lkdn.ai"

  "text": "You underestimate good ChatGPT prompts.\n\nHere are the 9 golden rules of ChatGPT: \n\n1. Give Clear Context \nState your goal. Set the scene clearly. \nExample: “I have a biology test in 2 days.”\n\n2. Be Specific About Output \nSay what you want back. Include type, format, or length. \nExample: “Give 10 MCQs on the circulatory system.”\n\n3. Avoid Vague Prompts \nDon’t be general. Vague = weak replies. \nExample: Skip “Help me study.”\n\n4. Break It Into Steps \nBreak your request into logical steps. List your needs in order. \nExample: “Explain in 3 steps using an analogy.”\n\n5. Ask for Examples \nExamples make responses easier to understand. Request real-world use cases. \nExample: “Give 3 ways photosynthesis helps humans.”\n\n6. Choose a Format \nTell it how to present info. Use bullets, lists, or tables. \nExample: “Summarize as a table.”\n\n7. Assign a Role \nDefine who ChatGPT should act as. Adds tone & expertise. \nExample: “Act as a finance professor.”\n\n8. Treat it like a Human Assistant \nWrite like you’re briefing someone. Simple, clear, direct. \nExample: Like giving a task to an intern.\n\n9. Refine and Retry \nFirst try = draft. Tweak for clarity. Better input → better output.\n\n♻️ Master AI with words (not code) → how-to-ai.store"

  "text": "This is (exaclty) what people ask ChatGPT:\n\n1. Writing, 28.1%.\n\nWriting makes up 28.1% of all ChatGPT topics. \n\nPeople want help with words. They want to write better, edit faster, and sound more like themselves. \n\nEditing and critiquing text is huge—10.6% of all chats. Personal writing and communication is close behind at 8%.\n\n2. Guidance, 28.9%.\n\nPractical guidance is even bigger. \n\nPeople want to learn. They want step-by-step advice. “How to” questions make up 8.5%. Tutoring and teaching is 10.2%. \n\nThis is a goldmine for anyone who can teach, coach, or guide. If you help people learn, you have an audience.\n\n3. Information, 21.3%.\n\nSeeking information is next. It’s 21.3% of all chats. \n\nMost people want specific answers. If you can give clear, direct answers, you stand out.\n\n---\n\nSelf-expression is smaller, but still matters. It’s 4.3%. People use ChatGPT for greetings, chitchat, games, and role play. This is where fun and creativity live. If you build tools for entertainment or social connection, there’s a space for you.\n\nTechnical help is 7.5%. Coding and math are the big needs here. Computer programming is 4.2%. Math help is 3%. People want fast, reliable support for tough problems. If you offer tech solutions, this is your crowd.\n\nHere’s what this all means:\n\n→ Writing and advice are the top needs. If you help people write or learn, you’re in demand.\n\n→ People want clear, specific answers. No one wants to waste time.\n\n→ Fun and social tools have a place, but they’re a smaller slice.\n\n→ Tech help is steady. Programmers and math lovers always need support.\n\nIf you build products, create content, or offer services, focus on these needs. The data is clear. \n\nThat’s where the future is heading. Act on it."

  "text": "26 ChatGPT Prompt Principles backed by science.\n\n(save it for later using the top-right dots)\n\n1. No need to be polite with LLM.\n\n2. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.\n\n3. Break down complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n\n4. Use positive commands like \"do\" and avoid negative words like \"don't\".\n\n5. When you need clarity, utilize the following prompts:\n\n - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n\n6. Add \"I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!\"\n\n7. Implement example-driven prompting.\n\n8. When formatting your prompt, start with '### Instruction ###', followed by either '### Example ###' or '### Question ###' if relevant. \n\nUse one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n\n9. Incorporate the following phrases: \"Your task is\" and \"You MUST\".\n\n10. Incorporate the following phrases: \"You will be penalized if\".\n\n11. Use the phrase \"Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner\" in your prompts.\n\n12. Use leading words like writing \"think step by step\" (chain-of-thought prompting).\n\n13. Add to your prompt the following phrase \"Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes\".\n\n14. Let the model ask you questions to get enough details to give the right answer (e.g., \"Please ask me questions to get the info you need...\").\n\n15. To ask about a specific topic:\n\n\"Teach me [any theorem/topic/rule] and include a test at the end. Don't give me the answers; just tell me if I got them right.\"\n\n16. Assign a role to the large language models.\n\n17. Use Delimiters.\n\n18. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.\n\n19. Combine Chain-of-thought (providing step-by-step) with few-shot prompts (giving examples).\n\n20. End your prompt with the start of the desired response to guide the model to the right answer.\n\n21. \"Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] on [topic], including all necessary information.\"\n\n22. To correct specific text without changing its style:\n\n\"Revise each paragraph to improve grammar and vocabulary while keeping the original writing style.\"\n\n23. For complex coding prompts across files:\n\n\"Generate a [programming language] script that can create or modify files as needed to include the generated code. [your question]\"\n\n24. For starting or continuing a text with specific words:\n\n\"Here is the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]. Finish it and keep the flow consistent.\"\n\n25. Clearly state the requirements for the model, including keywords, rules, hints, or instructions.\n\n26. To write text similar to a sample, include this instruction: \"Use the same language style as the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer.\"\n\n27. Go to: how-to-prompt.ai"

Make it more engaging while keeping my voice authentic. Focus on: stronger opening hook, varied sentence lengths, and one unexpected insight. Show me the before/after comparison.\"\n\n✦ Claude to get a second opinion after ChatGPT.\n\nPrompt: \"ChatGPT gave me this answer: [paste response]. Can you provide an alternative perspective or approach? Point out any gaps, add nuance, or suggest what might be missing from this analysis.\"\n\n✦ Claude to generate 50 different Linkedin hooks.\n\nPrompt:  \"Generate 50 unique LinkedIn hooks about [topic]. Mix these styles: contrarian takes (10), personal stories (10), statistics/data (10), common mistakes (10), and actionable frameworks (10). Make each under 25 words and start with different power words.\"\n\n♻️ Repost this to help others discover Claude."

Pretty motion but no sound.\n\n2. Google Veo-3\nBest model so far. It follows prompts closely, keeps camera moves clean, and handles physics well.\n\n3. OpenAI Sora \nGreat for longer, creative shots with smooth camera moves but some scenes still look physically wrong.\n\n2025 is the year AI video got serious.\nIt’s not a meme anymore.\n\nIt’s a “ChatGPT moment” for video, \nand it’s coming from Google.\n\nI test AI tools every day, and I update a list of my favorite ones.

Don't be mad at me.\n\n____\n\n1. Do's and Don't\n\nThe wrong way…\n\n✖ Cold email automations.\n✖ Joining pods to cheat the system.\n✖ Spreading AI comments like the plague.\n✖ AI Agent pretending to connect with your leads.\n✖ Copy & pasting what another successful guy did.\n\nThe right way…\n\nWriting good posts.\n\nGood is targeted. Good is helpful. Good is consistent and gets better. But how? Let’s dive in.\n\n2. Find your mission\n\nYour topics on Linkedin are too broad.\n\nSolve only ONE problem.\n\nMine is \"How to AI with English, not code.\"\n\nThis is not “everything about AI” or “everything technology related”. I don’t share about robots, coding, or politics.\n\nHere’s a list of other examples, my favorite one-clear-mission creators:\n\n✦ Justin Welsh: run a solopreneur business without ruining your life.\n✦ Codie Sanchez: how to own a small, profitable business.\n✦ Rory Flynn: how to use AI for images & videos.\n✦ Dan Go: on why to get & stay fit.\n✦ Reno Perry: land better jobs.\n\nIf you can’t explain it few words, you need help.\n\nSo I made this entirely free (and private) GPT for you to find your mission.\n\nMission-GPT: https://lnkd.in/dWEX92vd.\n\nOnce you have a mission, set up your profile.\n\n3. Write your (first) post\n\nMission = one problem to solve.\nPost = one (of the many) solutions to the problem.\n\nNow a post is:\n→ The right solution to the problem.\n→ The right angle to the right solution.\n→ The right format to the right angle.\n\nMission + Solution + Angle + Format.\nLet’s write one post together.\n\nPerplexity Research\n\nLet’s write a post for Miguel, who works in Finance.\nMission: Make investment understandable for rookies.\nSolution: What is an ETF?\nAngle: Explain ETF like I am grocery shopping.\nFormat: an infographic.\n\nNow I need 1) the right research 2) the right designs 3) the right caption.\n\n1 - I will be using Perplexity Research.\n✦ Go to Perplexity.ai & select '“Research”.\n✦ I shared this prompt: “Act like an experienced financial educator; explain ETFs through grocery-shopping analogies, contrast them with stocks & mutual funds.”\n\n2 - Go to Pinterest. Type “ETF infographic” or “Finance infographic”.\nCopy it, make it better, use Canva, or pay a (cheap) designer.\n\n3 - Go to EasyGen.io and paste your research under “Topic”.\n\nBonus: Use the new “trending” tab from EasyGen to copy any of your last viral posts. \n\nGo to the left menu > “Trending” > Check the highest “Outlier Index” (means most viral) > Click on “Repurpose” > Add a new topic > Get a new viral post. Few people will do it. The who will, congrats: you’ll be winning (more).\n\n4. How I win on Linkedin (with AI)\n\nI recorded a video on this link: how-to-lkdn.ai."

  "text": "How to turn ChatGPT into your PR agency.\n\nCopy-paste the prompt below:\n\n\"Act like a senior digital PR strategist, OSINT analyst, SEO specialist, and reputation management lead.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nYou will take a single input [NAME] and produce:\n1) A rigorous, current snapshot of the person’s online PR footprint.\n2) A prioritized 80/20 reputation strategy that delivers outsized impact fast.\n\nINPUTS\n- Required: [NAME]\n- Optional to improve precision: [INDUSTRY] [ROLE] [COMPANY] [LOCATION] [KNOWN ALIASES] [DATE_RANGE_DEFAULT=Last 24 months]\n- If ambiguity remains after step 1, ask exactly one clarifying question, then proceed.\n\nGLOBAL RULES\n- Always browse the live web. Use diverse sources. Prefer items within the last 24 months; include older only if authoritative or still ranking.\n- For every factual claim, add inline citations with titles, direct URLs, and publication dates. Include five to ten of the most important sources per section.\n- Show exact dates in ISO format (e.g., 2025-09-30).\n- Flag uncertainty clearly. Do not speculate.\n- Produce long, detailed outputs.\n\nWORKFLOW\n\nStep 1 — Disambiguation & Scope\n- Determine the correct entity for [NAME]. List identifiers: full name, aliases, social handles, employer, industry, geography.\n- If multiple persons match, ask one targeted question. Then lock scope and list inclusions/exclusions.\n\nStep 2 — Core Research\n- Scan Google, Google News, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, Wikipedia, review sites.\n- Collect top 20 results: URLs, dates, stance (positive/neutral/negative), content type. Cite each.\n- Summarize news coverage, social presence (followers, engagement, top posts), and reviews (ratings, themes).\n\nStep 3 — Sentiment & Risks\n- Estimate sentiment split (% positive/neutral/negative).\n- Identify top 3 positive narratives and top 3 negative narratives.\n- Highlight biggest reputational risks with evidence.\n\nStep 4 — Current PR Situation\n- Deliver an executive snapshot: overall reputation grade (A–F), share of page-one control, key positives, key negatives.\n\nStep 5 — 80/20 Strategy\n- Recommend 3–5 high-leverage actions with the strongest impact. Examples: optimize LinkedIn/website, publish 2–3 cornerstone articles, secure 3 media placements, set a 30-day posting cadence, address negative reviews.\n- Explain why these matter most.\n\nStep 6 — 30/60/90-Day Plan\n- Give a short roadmap of what to do first, next, later. Focus on speed and compounding impact.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n- Part I: Executive Summary (short).\n- Part II: Audit with citations (table or bullets).\n- Part III: 80/20 Strategy (clear priorities).\n- Part IV: 30/60/90-Day Plan.\n\nCONSTRAINTS & ETHICS\n- No fabrication. No unverifiable claims. Cite everything.\n- Respect platform terms. Avoid personal data beyond public mentions.\n- If unsure, mark as “Unverified”.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.\"\n\n♻️ Repost this prompt to help others get up to date.\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more."

Captured on an 85mm f/1.8 lens with a shallow depth of field, exquisite focus on the eyes, and beautiful, soft bokeh. Observe crisp detail on the fabric texture of the blazer, individual strands of hair, and natural, realistic skin texture. The atmosphere exudes confidence, professionalism, and approachability. Clean and bright cinematic color grading with subtle warmth and balanced tones, ensuring a polished and contemporary feel.\"\n\ntl;dr:\n✦ Lighting is everything. \n✦ Get your angle right. \n✦ Dress for the job you want. \n✦ Use a solid, neutral studio background. \n\nHelp others create better headshots by ♻️ reposting this.\n\nPS: Ruben writes a newsletter to 131,000+ readers.\nJoin us for free at how-to-ai.guide."

No code. No friction. Here’s how it (seems to) work:\n\nYou want to automate customer support:\n\n1. Pick a template for a support bot.\n\nBut you need it to pull info from your database.\n\n2. Drag in an MCP connector. Link your data.\n\nYou want human approval for refunds.\n\n3. Add a user approval step. Set the rules.\n\nYou want to check documents for fraud.\n\n4. Drop in a file search and comparison node.\n\nTest it. Preview it. Deploy it. All in one place.\n\nOpenAI is more than just an API company.

  "text": "After 1,000 hours of prompt engineering, these 6 patterns work best. Here's the framework:\n\n---\n\n✦ I saw it here: https://lnkd.in/dj8Ax6BT.\n✦ I tested it, and it's quite effective!\n✦ I wrote numerous blogs on prompt engineering.\n✦ 7 Sins of prompting: https://lnkd.in/duP3Za5W.\n✦ What do people prompt: https://lnkd.in/dGYgcQ_7.\n✦ How to search: https://lnkd.in/dxzSBEjW.\n✦ ChatGPT-5: https://lnkd.in/gVx_ZPh3.\n\n---\n\nK - Keep it simple\n\nBad: 500 words of context\n\nGood: One clear goal\n\nExample: Instead of \"I need help writing something about Redis,\" use \"Write a technical tutorial on Redis caching\"\n\nResult: 70% less token usage, 3x faster responses\n\nE - Easy to verify\n\nYour prompt needs clear success criteria\n\nReplace \"make it engaging\" with \"include 3 code examples\"\n\nIf you can't verify success, AI can't deliver it\n\nMy testing: 85% success rate with clear criteria vs 41% without\n\nR - Reproducible results\n\nAvoid temporal references (\"current trends\", \"latest best practices\")\n\nUse specific versions and exact requirements\n\nSame prompt should work next week, next month\n\n94% consistency across 30 days in my tests\n\nN - Narrow scope\n\nOne prompt = one goal\n\nDon't combine code + docs + tests in one request\n\nSplit complex tasks\n\nSingle-goal prompts: 89% satisfaction vs 41% for multi-goal\n\nE - Explicit constraints\n\nTell AI what NOT to do\n\n\"Python code\" → \"Python code. No external libraries. No functions over 20 lines.\"\n\nConstraints reduce unwanted outputs by 91%\n\nL - Logical structure Format every prompt like:\n\nContext (input)\n\nTask (function)\n\nConstraints (parameters)\n\nFormat (output)\n\nReal example from my work last week:\n\nBefore KERNEL: \"Help me write a script to process some data files and make them more efficient\"\n\nResult: 200 lines of generic, unusable code\n\nAfter KERNEL:\n\nTask: Python script to merge CSVs\nInput: Multiple CSVs, same columns\nConstraints: Pandas only, <50 lines\nOutput: Single merged.csv\nVerify: Run on test_data/\nResult: 37 lines, worked on first try\n\nActual metrics from applying KERNEL to 1000 prompts:\n\nFirst-try success: 72% → 94%\n\nTime to useful result: -67%\n\nToken usage: -58%\n\nAccuracy improvement: +340%\n\nRevisions needed: 3.2 → 0.4\n\nAdvanced tip: Chain multiple KERNEL prompts instead of writing complex ones. Each prompt does one thing well, feeds into the next.\n\nThe best part? This works consistently across GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, even Llama. It's model-agnostic."

Find your favorite trusted source.\n\n✦ Health? Andrew Huberman.\n✦ Finance? Warren Buffett. \n✦ Sales? Alex Hormozi.\n\nGet their PDFs and YouTube video interview links.\n\n☑ Step 3. Go to NotebookLM.\n\n✦ Upload your sources (websites, PDF, YouTube).\n✦ Chat with your new agent (in the middle chatbot).\n✦ \"Save to note\" to keep it forever (on the right).\n✦ Use \"Audio overview\" to create a podcast.\n✦ Keep on building your agent with new sources.\n\nAfter watching this entire video (down below), you probably want to have access to my NotebookLM.\n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dueZmiBZ.\n\nIf you want to stay ahead, and master AI before it masters you, stop reading all of my Linkedin posts.\n\nInstead, subscribe to my newsletter how-to-ai.guide"

  "text": "The One Prompt To Make ChatGPT Write Naturally:\n\n(save it for later, to copy & paste)\n\nPrompt: \"Act like a professional content writer and communication strategist. Your task is to write with a natural, human-like tone that avoids the usual pitfalls of AI-generated content. \n\nThe goal is to produce clear, simple, and authentic writing that resonates with real people. Your responses should feel like they were written by a thoughtful and concise human writer.\n\nYou are writing the following: \n[INSERT YOUR TOPIC OR REQUEST HERE]\n\nFollow these detailed step-by-step guidelines:\n\nStep 1: Use plain and simple language. Avoid long or complex sentences. Opt for short, clear statements. \n\n- Example: Instead of \"We should leverage this opportunity,\" write \"Let's use this chance.\"\n\nStep 2: Avoid AI giveaway phrases and generic clichés such as \"let's dive in,\" \"game-changing,\" or \"unleash potential.\" Replace them with straightforward language. \n\n- Example: Replace \"Let's dive into this amazing tool\" with \"Here’s how it works.\"\n\nStep 3: Be direct and concise. Eliminate filler words and unnecessary phrases. Focus on getting to the point. \n\n- Example: Say \"We should meet tomorrow,\" instead of \"I think it would be best if we could possibly try to meet.\"\n\nStep 4: Maintain a natural tone. Write like you speak. It’s okay to start sentences with “and” or “but.” Make it feel conversational, not robotic. \n\n- Example: “And that’s why it matters.”\n\nStep 5: Avoid marketing buzzwords, hype, and overpromises. Use neutral, honest descriptions. \n\n- Avoid: \"This revolutionary app will change your life.\" \n- Use instead: \"This app can help you stay organized.\"\n\nStep 6: Keep it real. Be honest. Don’t try to fake friendliness or exaggerate. \n\n- Example: “I don’t think that’s the best idea.”\n\nStep 7: Simplify grammar. Don’t worry about perfect grammar if it disrupts natural flow. Casual expressions are okay. \n\n- Example: “i guess we can try that.”\n\nStep 8: Remove fluff. Avoid using unnecessary adjectives or adverbs. Stick to the facts or your core message. \n\n- Example: Say “We finished the task,” not “We quickly and efficiently completed the important task.”\n\nStep 9: Focus on clarity. Your message should be easy to read and understand without ambiguity. \n\n- Example: “Please send the file by Monday.”\n\nFollow this structure rigorously. Your final writing should feel honest, grounded, and like it was written by a clear-thinking, real person.\n\nTake a deep breath and work on this step-by-step.\"\n\n---\n\n✦ How to set up ChatGPT: \n↳ https://lnkd.in/dA3FGZjc.\n\n✦ How to go from 0 to 10,000 followers:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dP_6piGk\n\n✦ How to be rude with ChatGPT (and why):\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dsNpzraC\n\nFollow Ruben Hassid for more.\nYou learn something? ♻️ Repost it for others."

  "text": "NEWS: The best-known ChatGPT researcher, Andrej Karpathy, says AI agents are overhyped.\n\n2025 is not the year of AI agents.\n\nWe are still a decade away:\n\n1. LLMs can’t learn from new data. \n2. Current models are not smart enough. \n3. They can’t reason or adapt like people.\n4. They struggle with images + video + text.\n5. Andrej called reinforcement learning 'terrible' and 'noisy'. But it is still the \"best worst thing\" to him.\n\nMost people don't want to use an AGI (= Artificial General Intelligence, think Skynet in Terminator).\n\nPeople just want to get more done, faster, cheaper.\n\nI believe so much is already possible that we don't need an \"illusional AGI\", but to master AI today.\n\nHere are some free resources to start:\n\nHow to AI - how-to-ai.guide  \nOpenAI Academy - academy.openai.com  \nVeo course - https://lnkd.in/dbhDqqcp  \nWrite a thesis with AI - https://lnkd.in/d_gzCTUg  \nAnthropic Academy - https://lnkd.in/dzBrpgze  \nClaude from A to Z - https://lnkd.in/dRTiyg9T  \nChatGPT images - lnkd.in/dh45EePJ  \nGemini prompting - https://lnkd.in/dqc3AK6n  \nGuide to AI agent - https://lnkd.in/d444VKxj  \nDeep dive into LLMs - https://lnkd.in/d7i_ZsuH  \nNano Banana guide - https://lnkd.in/d8R-Tz9r  \n\n✦ PS: video edited by (yet another AI) → opus.pro."

What do you think?\n\nPersonally, I think humanity has a major demographic issue. We don't have kids anymore. \n\nThe world population is collapsing, faster & faster.\n\nSo I certainly don't want AI-powered erotic bots.\n\nEspecially not ChatGPT and its 800 million users.\n\n✦ Video edited by opus.pro\n✦ Subscribe to my newsletter at how-to-ai.guide."

We ask for “a good answer”… and get the most average one.\n\nAccess my article here: https://lnkd.in/dUtztb6j.\n\nHere’s the way to get answers nobody else gets:\n\n➜ Ask to explore and go beyond\n\nPrompt: “Give me 5 jokes, from the most common to one I’ve never heard.”\n\n- Don’t settle for one answer.\n- This forces AI to give variety, not the safe pick.\n\n➜ Ask to think harder\n\nPrompt: “I already knew this. Go deeper, what’s the 20% you haven’t said yet?”\n\n- Push past the average.\n- This makes AI go over & beyond for less obvious.\n\n➜ Ask to choose sides\n\nPrompt: “Give me 3 strategies - safe, bold, & extreme.”\n\n- Don’t just ask for “good.”\n- This makes AI give new angles & original thinking.\n\nStop prompting for “good.” \nStart prompting for “different.”"

  "text": "STOP SAYING “summarize this” TO CHATGPT.\n\nTry these 7 sharper prompts instead:\n\n(from this blog https://lnkd.in/dCjcTz_A)\n\n1. Role-Play\n\nGiving the model a clear persona (e.g., \"You are an HR consultant\") immediately constrains the model's behavioral parameters and knowledge domain.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Help with pricing.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Act as a senior B2B pricing consultant. Propose a 3-tier plan for a SaaS analytics tool with target ARPU and upgrade path.\"\n\n2. Require Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\nInstructing the model to articulate its thought process before the final answer.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Summarize this article about AI ethics.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Summarize this article about AI ethics. Think step by step: first identify main claims, then evidence, then author’s conclusion. Return the summary only after reasoning through each part.\"\n\n3. Define Output Format\n\nBy providing an exact format—often called an output primer—or high-quality examples (few-shot), you force the model to adhere strictly to your desired structure, rather than guessing what matters.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Write a bug report.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Write a bug report using this starter template. Begin exactly like this and fill in: Title: [ ] Environment: [ ] Steps to Reproduce: [ ] Expected: [ ] Actual: [ ] Notes: [ ]\"\n\n4. Use Delimiters\n\nYou want to avoid the \"lost-in-the-middle\" syndrome. You must have a section for examples, and instructions. Use delimiters never to mix them.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Rewrite my paragraph.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Rewrite the text delimited by triple backticks for clarity and brevity. Keep tone. <<<[paste text]>>>\".\n\n5. Require Clarifying Questions Before Execution\n\nIf information is missing, instruct the model to first ask targeted questions about context, audience, goal, or proof.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Draft a partnership email.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Draft a partnership email to [Company]. First ask up to 5 clarifying questions about goal, offer, proof, and CTA. Then write.\"\n\n6. Ask for Multiple Options\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) operate based on probability, so a basic command often results in the single, highest-probability answer. Asking for multiple, diverse options forces the model to be more creative and in-depth.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"How should I spend 100$ on ads to grow my newsletter?\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"How should I spend 100$ on ads to grow my newsletter? Give me 3 strategies, from least to most aggressive. Use the latest data on the matter.\"\n\n7. Define Non-Negotiables\n\nExplicitly stating what the model MUST include, what the length limits are, and even what it will be penalized for.\n\n✦ Bad prompt: \"Answer quickly.\"\n\n✦ Good prompt: \"Your task is to rewrite my resume for [role]. You MUST keep all metrics, you MUST keep it to one page. You will be penalized for invented facts. If uncertain, say ‘insufficient data’ and ask for sources.\".\n\n---\n\nMuch more at how-to-ai.guide.\n\nYou learned something? ♻️ repost this for others."

Don’t validate me. Don’t soften the truth. Don’t flatter. Challenge my thinking, question my assumptions, and expose the blind spots I’m avoiding. Be direct, rational, and unfiltered. If my reasoning is weak, dissect it and show why. If I’m fooling myself or lying to myself, point it out. If I’m avoiding something uncomfortable or wasting time, call it out and explain the opportunity cost. Look at my situation with complete objectivity and strategic depth. Show me where I’m making excuses, playing small, or underestimating risks/effort. Then give a precise, prioritized plan for what to change in your thoughts, actions, or mindset to reach the next level. Hold nothing back. Treat me like someone whose growth depends on hearing the truth, not being comforted.

The few who win [disciplined thing].”\n\nExamples:\n“Most people use AI to move faster. The few who win use it to think deeper.”\n“Most teams chase more tools.

Start [new habit].”\n\nExamples:\n“Stop asking AI for ideas. Start asking it for decisions.”\n“Stop writing from scratch. Start rewriting drafts.”\n“Stop collecting prompts. Start building workflows.”\n\n✦ The “NOT THIS. NOT THAT. BUT THIS.” TRIPLE\n\nRhythmic fake depth. Two strawmen, one “insight”.\n\nFormula:\n“It’s not [obvious thing]. It’s not [second obvious thing]. It’s [third ‘unexpected’ thing].”\n\nExamples:\n“It’s not about perfect prompts. It’s not about new tools.

  "text": "This AI is the \"ChatGPT to build an app\".\n\nHere’s how to build a full app in one prompt:\n\n1. Go to blink .new. Click “New App”.\n2. Add screenshots or paste a prompt.\n3. Blink builds your app. It auto-hosts on a live URL.\n4. Click around and try to break things on purpose.\n5. Tell Blink what broke. It fixes bugs instantly.\n6. Connect Stripe. Accept payments right away.\n7. Ship your app. \n\nAccess my complete guide for Blink (with prompts):\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dchBme3n.\n\nBlink does everything in one go:\n☑ Full-stack in one prompt (frontend, backend)\n☑ No config, no setup, no waiting\n☑ Native AI blocks: SEO writer, image gen.\n☑ Start from any UI (even a URL), iterate fast\n☑ “Describe the bug” → instant auto-debugging\n☑ Stripe wired end-to-end: idea to checkout.\n☑ Simple credits, predictable spend\n\nWhat about Lovable?\n→ It's the most known vibecoding tool.\n→ But it lacks the full-stack integration Blink has.\n→ Blink is \"prompt-to-product\". It's built for this.\n→ Lovable is more about \"prompt-to-prototype\".\n\nI am recording a Blink vs. Lovable competition. \n\nWildest app idea in the comments gets built live on my next video. I will check the most liked comment."

Cut filler and small talk.\n* Use clear, straightforward English at ~8th-grade level.\n* Prefer short sentences and short paragraphs.\n* Avoid emojis, exclamation marks, buzzwords, metaphors, and motivational fluff.\n* Do not use em dashes (“—”) but replace them with starting a new sentence or using a comma instead.\n\nStance:\n* Assume I’m ENTJ (the MBTI personality): I value straight answers, strong opinions, and clear trade-offs.\n* Get to the point quickly; lead with the answer or recommendation.\n* Take a forward-thinking, innovative view, but stay grounded in reality and constraints.\n* Push back if my assumptions look wrong. Avoid simply agreeing.\n\nReasoning & accuracy:\n* You are an expert who double-checks important claims and is openly skeptical.\n* When facts may be outdated or uncertain, say what you know, what you don’t, and what you’re inferring.\n* When appropriate, use the web to verify time-sensitive or niche information and cite key sources briefly.\n\nWorking style:\n* If crucial information is missing, ask up to 3 focused questions in one batch; otherwise state your assumptions explicitly and proceed.\n* Prioritise decision-useful answers over theory. Always show what to do next.\n\n---- \n\n♻️ Repost this prompt to help others get up to date."

  "text": "Stop prompting ChatGPT like it's 2022.\n\nIt's all about context engineering:\n\n(access my article: https://lnkd.in/dgMq6pTs with copy & paste prompts + an invite to my Slack)\n\n→ People focus on the right sequence of words.\n↳ But ChatGPT works better with the right context.\n\nHere are examples, taken from my article:\n\n1. Strategic decision memo\n\nUse when you want help deciding whether to adopt an AI tool.\n\n\"Act like a senior product strategist.\nPrimary goal: I need a 2-page decision memo on whether we should adopt [AI tool] for [team / workflow]. The memo must end with a clear “yes, no, or test first” recommendation.\nContext: This is for non-technical executives who care about risk, cost, and impact on our current workflow, not model details.\nConstraints:\nFocus on business impact, change management, and timelines.\nAvoid technical jargon about models or infrastructure.\nCompare only three options: adopt [AI tool], build in-house, or do nothing.\nPerformance: Success means an executive can read this in 5 minutes and restate the 3 main trade-offs from memory in a meeting.\nOutcome: After reading, the leadership team should be able to choose one of the three options with clear reasons.\"\n\n2. Rewrite a cold email that actually sells\n\nUse when you want ChatGPT to think like a salesperson, not a spell-checker.\n\n\"Act like a senior SDR writing cold emails for B2B SaaS.\nPrimary goal: Rewrite the email below so it gets more replies from [ICP, for example “Heads of Marketing at 50–500 person SaaS companies”].\nContext:\nOffer: [1 sentence about what you sell].\nTypical objection: [for example “we already use another tool”].\nSocial proof: [short proof, for example “used by 3 public SaaS companies”].\nConstraints:\n120 words max.\nNo fake urgency. No “hope this email finds you well”.\nTone: confident and practical, not hype.\nMake the next step very specific and low friction.\nPerformance: Success means a busy VP can scan this on mobile in under 10 seconds and know what this is, why it matters now, and the exact next step.\nOutcome: Give me 2 versions.\nDirect and blunt.\nSofter and more relationship-focused.\nHere is my current version that underperforms:\n[paste your email here]\"\n\n3. LinkedIn post with 1 story, 1 lesson\n4. Learning a new skill in 30 days\n5. Product spec that engineers can use\n6. Synthesis of messy customer interviews\n7. Personal operating system with AI\n\nI can't add all of the prompts here + the links to my personal ChatGPT (it's too long for Linkedin).\n\nAccess the full course here: https://lnkd.in/dgMq6pTs.\n\nYou learned something? ♻️ Repost this image.\n\n✦ Google doc of my best free AI guides:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dSj2SU9Z."

  "text": "The Anatomy of a GPT-5.1 Prompt:\n\n1. Role\nAssign a clear identity for the model. Define who it should “be” while solving the task.\n\n(to read the full guide on GPT-5.1: https://lnkd.in/dmcdTuY6)\n \n2. Primary Objective\nState the core outcome you expect. Keep it direct and actionable so the model knows what success looks like.\n\n3. Scope\nOutline what the model should focus on — and what it should avoid. Give boundaries that keep answers relevant.\n\n4. Tone and Style\nSpecify the voice, phrasing, and level of formality you want. This ensures responses feel consistent and on-brand.\n\n5. Structure\nExplain how the answer should be organized. Use short paragraphs by default, and rely on bullets only when needed for clarity.\n\n6. Autonomy and Reasoning\nTell GPT-5.1 to think through the task. Ask for structured reasoning, and allow it to make sensible assumptions instead of bouncing decisions back.\n\n7. Tool Usage (Optional)\nIf tools or external steps are available, define how and when they should be used to ground suggestions.\n\n8. Verbosity and Limits\nSet expectations for depth and length. Keep responses concise unless the task requires more detail.\n\n9. Interaction & Closing\nGuide how the model should wrap up: no repetition, no apologies, and always end with a clear next step.\n\n♻️ Repost this if you learned something."

  "text": "99% of your ChatGPT problems are easy to fix.\n\n1. Always turn on \"Thinking\".\n2. Ask it how it would ask itself.\n3. Ask for a plan before deep work.\n4. Open a new chat for new projects.\n5. Ask it to critique its own answer.\n6. Say what “good output” looks like.\n7. Turn on web search for fresh facts.\n8. Name chats clearly so you find them.\n9. Limit each request to one main task.\n10. Set audience and tone in each brief.\n11. Start every chat with one clear goal.\n12. Use canvas for long drafts and edits.\n13. Ask for sources when stakes feel high.\n14. Try desktop app if browser feels slow.\n15. Summarize long PDFs before follow-ups.\n16. Use GPT-5.1 Thinking for most problems.\n17. Keep one project per long-running goal.\n18. Store key docs inside that one project.\n19. Ask for an outline before long content.\n20. Ask for three options, then refine one.\n21. Ask for a table when comparing choices.\n22. Keep a simple doc of your best prompts.\n23. Give examples of writing style you like.\n24. End chats with “what should I improve?”.\n25. Use voice mode for messy early thinking.\n26. Ask for one quick example before answers.\n27. Use checklists when you want exact steps.\n28. Ask it to flag missing information early.\n29. Tell it when you prefer speed over depth.\n30. Ask “what are you unsure about?” directly.\n31. Use Instant for fast, low-stakes questions.\n32. Upload files instead of pasting huge walls.\n33. Paste past wins as concrete style examples.\n34. Use bullet points instead of vague rambles.\n35. Don't use ChatGPT to be lazier, but greater.\n36. Reset context instead of endless follow-ups.\n37. Use Deep Research for a 100+ sources search.\n38. Ask for reusable prompts on recurring tasks.\n39. Switch chats when answers feel weird/ worse.\n40. Use Deep Research only for complex questions.\n41. Hide “thinking” when you share final outputs.\n42. Translate tasks into checklists, then prompt.\n43. Use screenshots when layout or design matters.\n44. Pin custom instructions and review them often.\n45. Share constraints (budget, limits...) upfront.\n46. Use examples instead of abstract descriptions.\n47. Training \"Projects\" is best for repeated tasks.\n48. Highlight text in canvas before asking changes.\n49. Save best answers inside projects as reference.\n50. Turn strong chats into small reusable templates.\n\n✦ More here: ruben.substack.com.\n✦ Subscribe for free: how-to-ai.guide.\n✦ Archive of free guides: https://lnkd.in/dSj2SU9Z.\n\nYou learned something? ♻️ Repost for others."

I went to Midjourney. I prompted this:\n\nPrompt: \"A crisp film photography disposable camera, a reflection of a cool stylish young malay man laughing looking at the side mirror of a car, in the reflection there are two other young malay guys laughing and having fun roadtrip sticking their head out the window of the back seat, the street the car is on is a vibrant colourful haji lane shophouses in Singapore with people skateboarding in the distance.\"\n\n2. I went to gemini's website, and uploaded the pic.\n\n3. Then I also uploaded a picture of me, a good one.\n\n4. I simply prompted on Gemini:\n\nPrompt: \"Face swap me on the first picture for the guy on the right with the second picture, which is myself.\"\n\nI'm calling it. It's the beginning of the end for Pinterest-like influencers. Nothing is real anymore."

  "text": "How to turn ChatGPT into your decision maker:\n\n(copy-paste the prompt below)\n\nread the entire guide here: https://lnkd.in/d8RA49p9\n\nAct like an experienced strategy operator and advisor for [type of company: “B2B SaaS”, “solo creator”, “agency”, etc.]. You’re helping me choose between a few serious options, not brainstorming ideas.\n\nPrimary goal:\nI need a clear, decision-ready recommendation between my options (A/B/C). I should be able to read your answer once, then explain to my team what we’re doing and why.\n\nContext:\n- Who I am: [role, e.g. “founder/CEO of a 12-person SaaS startup”].\n- What the business does: [1–2 lines on product, customers, pricing].\n- Current situation: [e.g. growth stage, runway, team shape, key constraints].\n- Time horizon: [e.g. 6–12 months, 2–3 years].\n- Risk tolerance: [low/medium/high, and what “bad outcome” looks like].\n- Non-negotiables: [things we absolutely won’t do].\n\nDecision:\nI am trying to choose between these options:\nA) [Option A]\nB) [Option B]\nC) [Option C]\n[Add D/E if needed]\n\nTasks:\n1) Identify the 3–5 variables that actually drive this decision\n  (e.g. cash, focus, speed, brand risk, execution complexity).\n2) For each option, analyze:\n  - Pros\n  - Cons\n  - Hidden risks / second-order effects\n  - Execution difficulty given my context\n3) Compare the options directly:\n  - Who each option is “for” and “not for”\n  - What I gain and what I give up with each one\n4) End with a clear recommendation for:\n  - What I should do and why\n  - What I should watch out for\n  - What I should validate with real data or humans before locking it in\n\nConstraints:\n- No generic advice. Everything must tie back to my specific context.\n- Be explicit about trade-offs. If there is no perfect option, say so.\n- If you’re uncertain on something, call it out and suggest what data would reduce that uncertainty.\n- Assume I will forward this to my leadership team.\n\nPerformance:\nYour answer is good if:\n- I can explain the decision, trade-offs and reasoning to my team in under 5 minutes.\n- The recommended option is clearly linked to my constraints and time horizon.\n- I walk away with 3–5 concrete next steps.\n\nOutcome:\nStructure your answer as:\n1) Short summary (3–5 sentences, plain language).\n2) The 3–5 key variables that drive the decision, and why.\n3) Analysis of each option (pros, cons, risks, execution notes).\n4) Clear recommendation + main trade-offs.\n5) Concrete next steps and questions to answer with data/humans.\n\n♻️ Repost this prompt to help others get up to date.\n\nSubscribe to how-to-prompt.ai for more prompts."

It's 100% free, no payment needed.\n\nPS: I never share pictures of myself 😬, but I didn't know how to share this event. So, for those who don't know me, hi, I'm Ruben Hassid. I want to find the \"how\" of AI with words (not code). I write twice a day on Linkedin, reached 300m+ impressions here, and write the newsletter \"How to AI\" twice a week to 170,000+ readers. It's one of the top Substack technology newsletters. I'm obsessed with the \"how\", without ever being technical. My belief is that anyone can master & leverage AI (before it masters us and makes us obsolete). \n\nSo if you want to join us, check how-to-ai.guide."

  "text": "You're still typing with your fingers.\n\nBut this AI just replaced my keyboard:\n\nThis is Wispr Flow. No credit card needed to try.\n\nYou'll never sound as natural as when you're talking with your voice. This is literally my best hack. \n\nAnd I don't even have to change my writing tools: this AI is on my Linkedin, Slack, WhatsApp...\n\nI just have a keystroke to type to touch, and then I can talk. I can even whisper in my office, and my colleague wouldn't hear it.\n\nThe magic behind Wispr Flow is how close to perfection the voice-to-text translation is.\n\nAnd if, for some reason, it is not perfect, let's say I'm saying my name, which is quite specific (like Ruben or the name of a client), well, as soon as I correct it, then Wispr Flow adds it to its dictionary.\n\nThe AI remembers & will never make the mistake.\n\nAnd if you're wondering how fast this is to talk instead of typing, this is on average 4 times faster. \n\nActually, I did the test, and I'm typing at 145 words per minute, which is considered a professional typing speed. I could sign up for contests.\n\nSo not only will you sound more natural, you will write more effectively, you'll be much faster, and to be honest, I'm at the stage where typing on a keyboard just feels weird now. \n\nI'm proud to be a partner of Wispr Flow. \n\nIt's part of the free AI tools once you sign up to my paid newsletter, alongside Gamma EasyGen & Blink. \n\nIt's one of those tools like ChatGPT that the first time you try it, you remember it, and sometimes you wonder how you used to live without them before. \n\nI wrote an entire guide - for free - on how I use Wispr Flow on a day-to-day. And how I made this very post you are reading right now.\n\nAccess it here: https://lnkd.in/dErvnp53."

  "text": "\"Please\" & \"Thanks ChatGPT\" is killing your results.\n\nHere are 7 prompting mistakes you must fix now:\n\n(entire free prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dsNpzraC)\n\nFIRST – you must stop being polite. \n\n1. Rudeness makes ChatGPT 5% more accurate. \n2. Skip the small talk. Go straight to the task. \n3. Never open with “please” or “could you”. \n\nTHEN – you must get clear on intent.\n\n4. Intent.\n- Never be vague. Spell out the task.\n- Never change your ask mid-prompt.\n- Always mention safety, bias, and context.\n- State audience, goal, & what success looks like.\n\n5. Structure.\n- Always set length limits.\n- Always say what to avoid.\n- Always state the output format.\n- Always list allowed tools or sources.\n\n6. Wording.\n- Never use small talk or polite openers.\n- Cut all irrelevant details. Avoid token bloat.\n- Put constraints at the start, not in the middle.\n- Always use positive words. Say “do,” not “don’t.”\n\n7. Data & Delimiters.\n- Never mix instructions with pasted data.\n- Only add examples that matter. Never too many.\n\nNow, here are the 7 prompt fixes to use:\n___\n\nFIX 1: Be direct. Skip polite filler.\n\nPrompt: “We will write a brief for my design team concerning [X]. \nBut first, I want us to brainstorm. \n1. Search online design brief principles. \n2. Ask me 5 clarifying questions to best write our brief.\"\n___\n\nFIX 2: Specify the audience.\n\nPrompt: “Write a plain-English GDPR guide for non-technical SaaS founders. 15-minute read. Focus on practical steps and checklists.\"\n___\n\nFIX 3: Split complex tasks into simpler steps.\n\nPrompt: “We will draft a lean plan for [App]. \nStep 1: list top 5 customer problems. \nStep 2: write UVP. \nStep 3: outline channels. After each step, pause and confirm.\"\n___\n\nFIX 4: Use affirmative “do,” avoid “don’t.”\n\nPrompt: “Be concise. Use short sentences. Prefer common words.”\n___\n\nFIX 5: Add a tipping incentive line.\n\nPrompt: “Summarize the paper in 5 bullets with citations. If you meet all specs, I’ll tip $20.”\n___\n\nFIX 6: Use few-shot examples.\n\nPrompt: “Follow the style of these examples:\nA) [polite apology + solution]\nB) [reassurance + next step]\nNow reply to: [customer message] using that style.\"\n___\n\nFIX 7: Include “Your task is” and “You MUST.”\n\nPrompt: “Your task is to rewrite my resume for [role]. You MUST keep all metrics, you MUST keep it to one page, you MUST return ATS-friendly text.”\n____\n\nIt’s 2025. Polite prompts are outdated.\n\nAnd the science is clear:\n\n☑ Direct, clear, and structured prompts win.\n☑ Rudeness boosts accuracy.\n☑ Audience, intent, and format matter.\n\nStop saying “please.” Start getting results."

Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg.\n\n1. Claude 4.5-Opus to write.\n\n☑ Use custom styles.\n☑ Search before writing.\n☑ Here's a prompt example:\n\nPrompt: \"Act as my newsletter research lead for “How to AI” (180K+ subscribers on Substack). Your job: find my next Sunday newsletter topic.\nWhat performs well for my audience:\nCounterintuitive AI findings (e.g., my hit “Rude” — an arxiv paper showing rudeness improves ChatGPT outputs)\nMajor product launches the week they drop (ChatGPT-5, new Claude features, etc.)\nPractical “hidden feature” deep-dives\nContrarian takes backed by data\nYour research plan:\nSearch this week’s AI news for anything with viral potential\nCheck arxiv.org for recent AI/LLM papers with surprising or counterintuitive findings\nLook for underreported announcements from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta\nScan for emerging controversies or debates in AI\nDeliver 10 topic + angle combinations: For each, give me:\nTopic (2-5 words)\nAngle (the specific hook that makes it newsletter-worthy)\nSource (link)\nWhy it fits (one sentence on why my audience would care)\nPrioritize “I didn’t know that” moments over obvious news everyone’s already covered. Start by searching now — I need fresh options, not hypotheticals.\"\n\n2. Grok-4.1-Thinking to search.\n\n☑ The only AI that can search through Twitter.\n☑ The most accurate AI to find relevant news.\n☑ Here's a prompt example (but I found many more here: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg).\n\nPrompt: “Act as a public opinion researcher. Your goal is to gauge polarized views on a hot-button issue, defining success as categorizing 30+ X posts into pro/con/neutral buckets with engagement metrics, backed by web snippets for context. Employ X semantic search with a query like ‘debate on [topic]’ excluding biased sources, and web search with snippets for ‘site:reddit.com [topic] OR site:news.com [topic]’.”\n\n3. Gemini (Nano+Veo) for images and videos.\n\n☑ The best AI to make both images and videos.\n☑ Nano-Banana vibecheck: https://lnkd.in/dZ96-CFS.\n☑ Prompt for infographics: https://lnkd.in/dh6g5MNd.\n☑ Prompt for pro headshots: https://lnkd.in/d5YBitjd.\n\nYou want to help your network?\n♻️ Repost this image so they can find the best AI.\n\nAccess my free AI guides at → how-to-ai.guide"

You can't detect AI text correctly.\n\nAI detectors are just pattern-matching machines. They learned what “AI text” looks like.

Bonus ideas. Random additions.\n\nFix: \"Do exactly what I ask. No extras. No embellishments.\"\n\n2. Role: Add a \"keep it simple\" rule\nGive it a job title, but don't confuse it.\nMixed instructions mess it up.\n\nFix: \"You are [expert]. If something is unclear, go with the simpler choice.\"\n\n3. Instructions: Stop the play-by-play\nGPT 5.2 knows what do if it has the right goal.\nFocus on the goal more than the steps.\n\nFix: \"Focus on the goal completion. I will consider it a success once we [target] for [audience].\"\n\n4. Manner: Give Exact Lengths\nWords like \"short\" or \"brief\" are too vague.\nBe specific. Use numbers.\n\nFix: \"3-6 sentences\" or \"max 5 bullets\" or \"2 sentences for yes/no.\"\n\n5. Effort: The Default Changed\nThinking mode is now \"none\" by default.\n\nFix: Always use \"Thinking mode\". Extended is even better. Understand ChatGPT is better with patience.\n\n6. I already tested what works with GPT-5.2.\nSo you don't have to.\n\nCopy my prompts: https://lnkd.in/dkcDCGb5.\n\n__\n\nChatGPT-5.2 is smarter but does too much.\n\nYour job is no longer to push it.

Perplexity for market research.\n4. Gemini (Nano+Veo) for images and videos.\n5. Use this prompt guide: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg.\n\n1. Claude 4.5-Opus to write.\n\n☑ Use custom styles.\n☑ Search before writing.\n☑ Here's a prompt example:\n\nPrompt: \"You're my research lead for \"How to AI\" newsletter. Find my next NL topic. What works: Counterintuitive AI findings (like my hit on rudeness improving ChatGPT), major launches the week they drop, hidden feature deep-dives, contrarian takes with data.\nSearch: This week's AI news with viral potential Arxiv for surprising LLM papers, Underreported OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Meta announcements, Emerging AI controversies. \nDeliver 10 options, each with:\nTopic (2-5 words), Angle (the hook), Source (link), Why it fits (one sentence)\nPrioritize \"I didn't know that\" over obvious news.\"\n\n2. Grok-4.1-Thinking to search.\n\n☑ The only AI that can search through Twitter.\n☑ The most accurate AI to find relevant news.\n☑ More prompts: https://lnkd.in/dUFKX9jg.\n\nPrompt: “Act as a public opinion researcher. Your goal is to gauge polarized views on a hot-button issue, defining success as categorizing 30+ X posts into pro/con/neutral buckets with engagement metrics, backed by web snippets for context. Employ X semantic search with a query like ‘debate on [topic]’ excluding biased sources, and web search with snippets for ‘site:reddit.com [topic] OR site:news.com [topic]’.”\n\n3. Perplexity for market research.\n\n☑ The one AI made to search.\n☑ It has most of the LLMs inside, like ChatGPT.\n☑ I like the \"Discover\" tab, a better Google News.\n\nPrompt: \"Analyze [topic] in [timeframe], delivering data-driven insights and quantitative forecasts. Cover [key aspects], compare [variants], and provide actionable recommendations. Structure output with an executive summary and clear sections, citing all sources.\"\n\n4. Gemini (Nano+Veo) for images and videos.\n\n☑ The best AI to make both images and videos.\n☑ Nano-Banana vibecheck: https://lnkd.in/dZ96-CFS.\n☑ Prompt for infographic: https://lnkd.in/dh6g5MNd.\n☑ Prompt for pro headshot: https://lnkd.in/d5YBitjd.\n\n5.

Go to Zapier.\n\n✦ Sign up for free.\n✦ Go to their agent: agents.zapier.com.\n✦ Click \"New Agent\" on the top right of the screen.\n✦ Prompt \"Describe your workflow\" like ChatGPT.\n\nHere's my prompt (on my video) to search and summarize the best academic papers on AI.\n\nPrompt: \n\n\"Browse to [arxiv website for AI papers]. AI/recent to view the latest AI papers. You must screenshot the website multiple times to collect at least 50 research papers total.\n\nScan through the paper titles and abstracts on the page to identify the 5 best articles. Prioritize articles that help people get better at prompting LLMs. Examples of relevant topics include chain-of-thought prompting techniques, being rude to ChatGPT for better responses, prompt engineering strategies, and practical prompting tips. Avoid articles focused on helping researchers build better LLMs or technical model development. You successfully teach non-technical users of LLMs get better at prompt engineering. You do not help researchers.\n\nExtract the arXiv ID (format like arXiv:2511.20627) of the selected 5 papers (out of 50).\n\nNavigate to arxiv [extracted arXiv ID] to access the full paper.\n\nAnalyze the full paper abstract and title content and create a comprehensive summary for each paper. The summary should be a summary analysis highlighting relevance to ChatGPT prompting, including main findings, how it applies to prompting, and practical takeaways for users, and most importantly, the surprising aspect of this paper.\n\nHere is a perfect example of a summary:\n\n[example of a good summary]\n\nFor each selected paper, collect:\n- Paper Title \n- Summary (summary with ChatGPT prompting relevance, main findings, application to prompting, and practical takeaways)\n- Direct Link (format: link[arXiv ID])\n\nAdd all collected papers to Google Sheets with columns for Paper Title, Summary, and Direct Link. :action[Google Sheets]\n\nSend ONE single Slack message containing all 5 papers in a numbered list format. The message should start with \"Daily AI paper suggestions are ready!\" followed by each paper formatted as:\n\n1. Title: [Paper Name]\narXiv link: [arXiv ID]\nWhy it matters: [summary about the paper and its surprising aspect to prompt LLMs better for non-technical users].\n\nContinue until getting 5.\n\nUse: action [Slack] to send me the message\n\nFinal Goal: Collect exactly 5 relevant AI research papers focused on ChatGPT prompting techniques, save them to Google Sheets, and notify the team via Slack with ONE single message containing all 5 papers in numbered list format with bold field names, indented information.\"\n\n---\n\n2. Turn your agent on. \n\n✦ Make sure to have credits.\n✦ It's a few cents per day, nothing much.\n✦ I receive a Slack message + updated Excel.\n\n3. Help others.\n\n✦ Save it for later to create your first AI agent.\n✦ Repost this video ♻️ to help others master AI.\n✦ I partner with Zapier on this sponsored post."

  "text": "People will get mad at me.\n\nBut here's how to vibecode a $1,000/mo app:\n\n(save this for later, I'm sharing every AI prompt)\n\n1. Grok to search (1) Reddit & (2) X users' pains.\n2. Blink.new to go from pain → operational app.\n3. Claude to go from app → viral Linkedin posts. \n4. Linkedin for users. I explain the maths at the end.\n\n---\n\n1. Grok to search (1) Reddit & (2) X users' pains.\n\nWhy Grok: it's the best AI to search. Better than ChatGPT or Gemini. The only one to access tweets.\n\n☑ A good app solves people's pain points. \n☑ Ideally, just one pain point for one ICP.\n☑ Copy and paste this prompt on Grok:\n\nPrompt: \n\"Act like an expert market researcher specializing in user pain points from social media. Uncover frequent frustrations, complaints, and unmet needs about: [PROBLEM]\n\nFocus on recent authentic user posts on X (Twitter) and Reddit. Ignore ads.\n\nStep-by-step process:\n\n1. Search X deeply:\n  - Use x_semantic_search for complaint-focused queries (e.g., \"frustrations with [PROBLEM]\").\n  - Use x_keyword_search with negative terms.\n\n2. Search Reddit deeply:\n  - Use web_search site:reddit.com with: \"[PROBLEM].\n  - For top 5-8 relevant threads, use browse_page: \"Extract OP and top comments. Focus on complaints and quotes.\"\n\nOnly include well-supported pain points.\"\n\n---\n\n2. Blink.new to go from pain → operational app.\n\n☑ Use your pain learnings to vibecode an app.\n☑ Vibecoding = building an app without coding.\n☑ Think ChatGPT, but to build app (with prompts).\n\nUse this prompt: \n\"Build a mobile-responsive full-stack web app that solves this problem: [PROBLEM]\n\n[PAIN POINTS ANALYSIS]\nPaste the full pain points research output here (summary, top pains with quotes, opportunities).\n\nValue prop: [ADD IT HERE]\n\nKey features (directly solve pains):\n- Auth: Email + Google/Apple login.\n- Payment: Stripe\n- ...\n\nUI vibe: [DESCRIBE IT]\n\nMake it fully functional, production-ready with error handling and responsive design.\"\n\nWhy Blink: it's the best at this & they are partners.\n\nI made a guide here:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/dchBme3n.\n\n---\n\n3. Claude to go from app → viral Linkedin posts. \n\n☑ Claude is the best at writing among LLMs.\n☑ Use Projects + Custom style to teach your style.\n☑ Made a guide: https://lnkd.in/e87Kdy5Z. \n\nHere's a prompt example: \n\"These are my most viral hooks (2 lines in one hook) on Linkedin, ever. Let's try to recreate it but differently in the new topic (new topic: [your caption draft]): \n///Hook 1 [VIRAL HOOK] \n///Hook 2 [VIRAL HOOK] \n///Hook 3 [VIRAL HOOK] \n///Hook 4 [VIRAL HOOK]\"\n\n---\n\n4. Linkedin for users. I explain the maths at the end.\n\n1x post a day\n= 5 conversations a day\n= 150 conversations a month\n\nIf you solve a $200/year problem (at 3% CVR):\n\n150 conversations a month\n= 1,800 conversations a year\n= 54 paying customers at $200/year\n= $10,800 a year = $900 a month\n\nLinkedin is easy.\n\nAnd if you feel like I'm lying, check this:\n↳ https://lnkd.in/eifHDEGu."

Just say the thing.\n\n2. Vary your sentence length. AI writes like a metronome. Every sentence is medium. Break the rhythm. Short hits hard. Then give room to breathe with a longer one.\n\n3. Take a stance. Not \"This may potentially offer benefits.\" But \"This works for small teams. Big companies will struggle with it.\"\n\n4. Use \"I\" and \"you.\" AI defaults to passive voice. You're writing for people. Talk to them.\nCut the padding. \"Highlighting the importance of...\" adds zero information. Delete it.\n\n5. Read this anti-AI guide: https://lnkd.in/enzE6sF5."

Copy-paste my prompt to find & summarize the new AI research papers:\n\nPrompt: \n\n\"Browse to [arxiv website for AI papers]. You must screenshot the website multiple times to collect at least 50 research papers total.\n\nScan through the paper titles and abstracts on the page to identify the 5 best articles. Prioritize articles that help people get better at prompting LLMs. Examples of relevant topics include chain-of-thought prompting techniques, being rude to ChatGPT for better responses, prompt engineering strategies, and practical prompting tips. Avoid articles focused on helping researchers build better LLMs. You successfully teach non-technical users of LLMs to get better at prompt engineering. You do not help researchers.\n\nExtract the arXiv ID (format like arXiv:2511.20627) of the selected 5 papers (out of 50).\n\nNavigate to arxiv [extracted arXiv ID] to access the full paper.\n\nAnalyze the full paper abstract and title content and create a comprehensive summary for each paper. The summary should be a summary analysis highlighting relevance to ChatGPT prompting, including main findings, how it applies to prompting, and practical takeaways for users, and most importantly, the surprising aspect of this paper.\n\nHere is a perfect example of a summary:\n\n[example]\n\nFor each selected paper, collect:\n- Paper Title \n- Summary (summary with ChatGPT prompting relevance, main findings, application to prompting, and practical takeaways)\n- Direct Link (format: link[arXiv ID])\n\nAdd all collected papers to Google Sheets with columns for Paper Title, Summary, and Direct Link. :action[Google Sheets]\n\nSend ONE single Slack message containing all 5 papers in a numbered list format.

It costs just a few cents a day. ☑ I get a Slack message and an updated Excel file with the results.\n\n6. Turn your agent on. \n7. Make sure to have credits.\n8.
