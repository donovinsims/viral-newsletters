Hi friend,

Come see me live in NYC, Boston, Denver, Austin, Salt Lake City & Chicago – [https://chriswilliamson.live](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/75u97w2wevh8h64nr6etniwzgmo66tnh2006/reh8hohme56808t2/aHR0cHM6Ly9jaHJpc3dpbGxpYW1zb24ubGl2ZQ==)

**Here are some rules about overthinking:**

* You can’t think your way out of a feeling problem. Overthinking is underfeeling. Trying to think your way into feeling emotions is like trying to drink your way sober.
* Trying to think your way out of overthinking is like trying to sniff your way out of a cocaine addiction.
* “Overthinking invents more problems than it solves.” — Gurwinder Bhogal
* Your brain ruminates because it hates uncertainty so much that it would rather fantasise a catastrophe than deal with not knowing what the future holds.
* Unpopular opinion: your brain ruminates because you are getting something out of the rumination. Finding out how it secretly serves you is the first step toward overcoming it.
* You never get paralysed by overthinking positive outcomes, you only overthink about terrible outcomes. Fear does not keep you safe, it keeps you trapped. Whatever you fear establishes the boundaries of your freedom. If you’re afraid of heights you stay low, if you’re afraid of people you stay alone.
* Most people don’t think about things enough. You are probably not one of them.
* In my experience, the more you think about yourself, the harder it is to access happiness. In this way reflection and personal development is a double-edged sword – you need to self-assess to know what to work on, but intense self-assessment is super restrictive to your quality of life.
* The amount you overthink is directly inverse to how much you live life. Do not trade the thing you want for the thing that is supposed to facilitate it.

## MODERN WISDOM

I do a podcast where I pretend to have a British accent.

**This week’s upcoming episodes:**

Monday. Simon Sinek – where does meaning come from in life, how can you find more purpose, what is Simon’s best advice for handling low mood, what do Gen Z need to learn from Millennials and where does resilience come from? Listen now on [Spotify](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/75u97w2wevh8h64nr6etniwzgmo66tnh2006/m2hdrzlru5h37n4r3khm/aHR0cHM6Ly9zcG90aS5maS8yTFNpbVBu) and [Apple Podcasts](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/75u97w2wevh8h64nr6etniwzgmo66tnh2006/8ghrlo52tohox5r4o0ak/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBsZS5jby8yTU5xSWd3).

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1. **Your guy friends are attracted to you, and they think you’re attracted to them too.**

“A study of Americans finds that in platonic couples, the men are far more likely than the women to find their friend sexy, and far more likely to think she finds them attractive, too.

Indeed, a man’s assessment of how much his female friend fancies him matches how much he fancies her, and is unrelated to how she really feels.

Clearly men are prone to wishful thinking.” — The Economist

2. **Your brain is a machine gun at overthinking.**

“It’s been found that we can talk to ourselves at the equivalent of 4,000 words per minute, which is the rate an M-134 assault rifle shoots bullets.” — Will Storr

3. **You can just go and do things.**

“The permission you are waiting for does not exist.” — Jack Butcher

## LIFE HACK

**Get your bloodwork done.**

You need to know what’s happening inside of your body.

My favourite bloodwork company does a single test that allows you to check everything including; your cortisol levels, heart health, hormone levels like testosterone, screens for 50 types of cancer and even detects AMH levels in women which indicate ovarian reserves.

It’s the most comprehensive, simple and quick way to get bloodwork done.

This is the exact test I get every 6 months.
