**âThe world belongs to optimists.**

Because if youâre going to to do anything big you have to believe that it can happen.

Otherwise it never will.

Shaan Puri says âthe cynics get to be right and the optimists get to be richâ.

99% right, and 100% wrong.

Theyâre right 99% of the time.

But theyâre wrong 100%.

Because the only thing that matters is the big one at the end.

Your family and friends will say that every girl that you ever date is not good enough, except for the one time you find the girl that youâre actually going to marry.

Or that this business idea wonât work.

And you might have nine failures.

My first nine businesses didnât really amount to anything.

Nine.

As in the first one, I spent time on it, it failed.

Second one, this one will be different, spent time on it, failed.

Then the third one, this is the oneâ¦

Failed.

And then 6 more after that.

And itâs painful as shit because the whole time, everyone is telling you âI told you soâ.

And theyâre right.

Today.

But not forever.â â h/t Alex Hormozi

**This weekâs upcoming episodes:**

Monday.  
Eric Weinstein â 3.5 hours on the state of US politics, the problems of modern physics, his opinion on Joe Rogan, my biggest weaknesses as a human and much more. So good.

Thursday.  
Lyman Stone â one of the worldâs best demographic researchers on why birthrates are declining. Is it culture? Microplastics? Fertility? Education? Cost of living? Some fascinating new insights.

Saturday.  
2.5M Q&A â me again. How has attention changed me? Why did I bring Dan Bilzarian on the show? Whatâs my current training split? Why do I ban people on YouTube? Will I shave my head more?

## **THINGS IâVE LEARNED**

1.  
â**Gay men and lesbians commit crimes differently.**

âMen commit more crime than women â a lot more.

Nature or nurture?

A new study points to a large contribution of the former.

The study found that gay men commit fewer crimes than straight men, whereas lesbians commit more crimes than straight women.

This is consistent with the idea that same-sex sexual orientation involves a generalized cross-gender shift, which is likely the result of sex-atypical prenatal hormonal exposure.

Of course, if sex-atypical prenatal hormones affect crime rates in gay men and lesbians, sex-typical prenatal hormones presumably do the same in straight men and women.â â Steve Stewart-Williams

2.  
â**Everyone is jealous of what youâve got, nobody is jealous of how you got it.**

âNo man wants to become something, every man wants to be something already.â â Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

â

3.  
â**You can know someoneâs political ideology by their trust in mass media.**

73% of Democrats trust mass media. Up from 60% 20 years ago.

36% of Independents. Down from 55%.

And 10% of Republicans. Down from 40%.

## **LIFE HACK**

**Sleep with your phone outside of your bedroom.**

The OG of life hacks.

Instant 10% increase in quality of life.

Put your charger in the kitchen and watch your sleep go up, screentime go down and morning routine improve.

Donât even think about whining to me about using it for your alarm. Radio alarm clocks have existed for almost a hundred years

Big love,
