Still processing everything, thank you all.\n\nNext up: London XL show – Thursday November 28thhtt\n\nSpencer Greenberg (Modern Wisdom guest) tested the ability of 152 astrologers to see if they could demonstrate genuine astrological skill.\n\nBack in January, a study was run trying to predict 37 facts about people’s lives using their astrological sun signs (whether they are Pisces, Aries, etc) and I covered it on this newsletter.\n\nWhile personality tests were able to predict these facts decently well, sun signs couldn’t predict even a single one of them…\n\nSome astrologers criticised the original study for this, saying that sun signs/zodiac signs are just tabloid astrology – real astrologers use a person’s entire astrological chart.\n\n****Taking into account this criticism, Spencer got the help of 6 astrologers to design a new study:****\n\n****– In each round, each astrologer gets LOTS of information about a real person (answers to 43 questions) along with 5 full astrological charts  \n– They then predict which is the person’s real natal chart (the other 4 are decoys).****\n\nWhy this study design?\n\nOne of the most fundamental claims of astrology is that a person’s natal chart contains information about that person’s life and character.\n\nIf true, astrologers should be able to correctly choose a person’s chart at a rate well above random guessing.\n\nThe study results are based on 152 astrologer participants with prior astrological experience who predicted they would do better than random guessing at the task.\n\nEach astrologer tries to match people to their correct chart 12 times.\n\nIf they’re guessing completely at random (e.g., they have no skill because astrology doesn’t actually work), then they’ll get about 20% of questions right, or about 2.4 questions right (on average) out of 12.\n\nNeat aspects of this study design are that (1) if astrology doesn’t work, it’s impossible for astrologers to do better than random guessing at this task, while (2) for the study to come out in support of astrology, astrologers only need to do slightly better than random guessing.\n\nThese astrologers were quite confident in their ability to match people to charts.\n\nThose with the least experience believed (after they had completed participation) that they’d gotten 5 out of 12 right, and those with the most experience thought they’d gotten 10 out of 12 right.\n\nSo, how did astrologers do overall?\n\nIf they’d gotten even 23% of questions right (slightly above the 20% of random guessing), the study would have come out in favor of astrology.\n\n****But astrologers as a group performed indistinguishable from random guessing, getting < 21% right.****\n\nBut perhaps the less experienced astrologers were just dragging down the performance of the group?\n\nThe researchers looked at how performance varied based on astrological experience.\n\n****More experienced astrologers did not do better than less experienced ones despite being far more confident.****\n\nEven if most astrologers have no skill, there’s another way astrology could prove itself.\n\nIf even 1 of the 152 astrologers performed exceptionally well, that could provide meaningful evidence for astrology.\n\nThe researchers offered a $1000 prize for anyone getting at least 11 out of 12.\n\n****Unfortunately, despite more than half of the astrologers believing that they had gotten 6 or more questions right (after completing the task), in actual fact, not a single astrologer got more than 5 right.****\n\nOkay, so despite them believing they could do this task, astrologers seemed to have no ability to match people to their astrological charts.\n\nBut, even if they aren’t getting the answers right, do they at least agree with each other on what the right answers are?\n\nNo.\n\nAstrologers had very low agreement with each other on the chart for each person.\n\nIf astrologers picked charts at random, they would agree with each other 20% of the time.\n\nIn the study, even the most experienced astrologers only agreed 28% of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, despite believing they could do it, the 152 astrologers seemed to lack any ability to match people to their astrological charts. — h/t Spencer Greenberg"
