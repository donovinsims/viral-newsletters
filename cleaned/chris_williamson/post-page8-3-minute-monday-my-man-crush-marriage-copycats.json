was blinded in his left eye which he took two bullets in; survived four plane crashes; tunnelled out of a prisoner-of-war camp with one arm; rode into battle on a camel; was so strong he could rip a deck of cards in half; and tore off his own fingers when a doctor declined to amputate them.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nBorn to an aristocratic family in Belgium, Carton de Wiart attended Balliol College in Oxford to fulfil his father’s wishes of him going into law.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nInstead, at 19 he snook away from Oxford without telling his father, to join the Boer War.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe faked his name and age to be accepted as a volunteer and was dispatched to South Africa, his father still unaware of his absence.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was shot in the stomach and groin during an ambush.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n**When asked by a commanding officer if there were many Boers around he replied “No, but the few were very good shots”.**\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was returned to Britain to recover where his father accepted his military career before being redeployed back to South Africa.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was promoted to corporal for 24 hours before he was demoted back to trooper for threatening to punch a sergeant.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe lead a squadron of the Somaliland Camel Corps, literally on camel-back into an assault on an enemy fort.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was shot 3 times in the face; losing an ear and an eye before a ricocheting bullet hit him again, in the same eye.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n**de Wiart’s summary of the battle was “it had all been most exhilarating fun!”**\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nThe Army Medical Commission said he was permitted be deployed to the Western Front if he’d wear a glass eye, to which he agreed.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nBefore immediately throwing the eye out of the window of a taxi in London to replace it with a signature eye patch which he’d wear for the rest of his life.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nIn his first battle of WWI at The Second Battle of Ypres he came under artillery fire.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nde Wiart’s left hand was hit by shrapnel and fragments from his own wristwatch which destroyed everything except his palm and two dangling fingers.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nWhen the field doctor hesitated to amputate them, de Wiart just tore off the two remaining fingers himself.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nThe lower arm was later amputed.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nUnsatisfied with watching from the sidelines, he asked to be redeployed again, this time to the Battle of the Somme.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nBritish soldiers reported seeing de Wiart pulling pins from grenades with his teeth before throwing them at the enemy and firing and reloading his revolver with just one hand.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nDuring the assault on the village of La Boiselle, France, he took command of 3 leaderless units.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nWith no field radios or telephones he decided to be his own messenger by running back and forth between all 3 units through enemy gunfire to give his orders.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was awarded the Victoria Cross “for most conspicuous bravery, coolness, and determination during severe operations of prolonged nature”.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was then shot through the back of the head.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nDidn’t die.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nIn 3 subsequent battles he was shot in the ankle, hip, leg and ear.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nDidn’t die.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nAfter each stay in hospital he just regained full mobility and returned to battle.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nNow after the victory of World War 1, could he finally rest up and enjoy his retirement?\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nWrong.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n**He was recalled into service in 1940, despite now being 60 years old and a one-eyed amputee.**\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nShortly after, a plane he was travelling in was shot down by a German fighter plane over a fjord.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nRather than get into an emergency rubber dinghy where the circling enemy aircraft could have picked him and his crew off, de Wiart treaded water with one arm until the plane ran out of ammo and left.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nAfter being picked up by the Navy, he was redeployed on a secret mission personally planned by Winston Churchill.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nThis time the Wellington Bomber he was travelling in crash landed into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nde Wiart then swam to shore, with one arm, while also carrying an injured comrade, who survived.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was immediately taken prisoner by the Italians and sent to the highest security prisoner of war camp for officers in Vincigliata near Florence.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was a part of at least five escape attempts, one of which involved digging a 60ft tunnel under the castle walls.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nAfter 7 months of tunnel digging WITH ONE ARM, de Wiart and 5 other prisoners escaped.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n**He then evaded capture for 8 days disguised as an Italian peasant in Northern Italy despite the fact that he couldn’t speak Italian and was 62 years old with an eye patch, one empty sleeve and multiple injuries and scars.**\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe was then recaptured but surprisingly ended up being used by the Italians to facilitate their armistice with the Allies.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHaving been a prisoner of war for months at this point, Carton de Wiart was not dressed appropriately for meetings with dignitaries so the Italians offered to purchase him a suit from an Italian tailor in Rome to which he protested unless it was a suit from Saville Row because he “didn’t want to look like a gigolo”.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe then became Chuchill’s head of relations with China before retiring.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nHe died on June 5th 1963 at his family estate in Ireland.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n**Describing his experiences, he wrote, “Frankly, I had enjoyed the war.”**\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nWhen people ask why I’m not cynical about the future, it’s because of men like Sir Adrian Paul Ghislain Carton de Wiart.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nI adore these stories because it shows the limitless resilience of humans.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nYou can cope with whatever life throws at you.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\nAnd if you can’t, just tear your own fingers off and keep going.\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n(h/t to Biographics for their amazing research on this guy)\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n\n\\n\\n\\n\\n"
