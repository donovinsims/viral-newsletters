David Deutsch said, “Beware of the difference between prediction and prophecy. Prophecy purports to know things which cannot be known.”\n\nIs this thing I’m worried about actually a problem, or am I looking for problems to worry about because they make me feel in control?\n\nWhat in my field do I think is a law (works all the time) but is actually just a rule (works some of the time)?\n\nWhat do I think is a universal truth but is actually just a norm unique to my own culture?\n\nWhat was true a generation ago that no longer is, and who is clinging to that old truth?\n\nWhat is partially true but I believe in it so absolutely, and take it so seriously, that I’ve turned it into a dangerous belief?\n\nAre there things going well in my life today that I will look back on and wish I had quit while I was ahead?\n\nIs there something in my life I think I’m “passionate” about or “focused” on but I’m actually just addicted to it?\n\nDo I spend more time defending what I already know instead of trying to learn something new?\n\nAre there people in my life who I consider kind and compassionate but they’re actually just too shy to tell me hard truths?\n\nWhat would Instagram look like if it were an honest reflection of people’s life, instead of a curated highlight reel?\n\nAm I being as nice as I could be, rather than just as nice as I need to be?"
