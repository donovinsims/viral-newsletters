Is it worth it?**\n\nNow imagine a world where you’re disliked by everybody, but you love yourself.\n\nI propose that self-love-you would be happier.\n\n**Because ultimately, in some taoist, roundabout way, the reason we want validation from others is to give us a good enough reason to validate ourselves.**\n\nIf you compromise yourself in order to gain favour with other people, you’ll know.\n\nEven if you think you’re not keeping score, your subconscious is.\n\nAnd given that you’re the sort of person who listens to Modern Wisdom, you probably keep score a lot more accurately than is typical.\n\nHow do you expect to have faith in yourself if you can’t even keep your own word?\n\nHere’s the problem.\n\n**We sacrifice the thing we want (self worth) for the thing which is supposed to get it (validation).**\n\nPrioritise yourself."
