Don’t pathologise the kindest parts of your nature.”\n\nBut in many ways I didn’t CHOOSE to check in on them, I had to.\n\n**Is it virtuous to do a good thing if you didn’t have any other choice other than to do the good thing?**\n\nWell, the impact was good and positive so, kind of?\n\nBut there’s something about it being compelled and less effortful or conscious that seems to derogate the virtuosity.\n\nSo is it more virtuous to do a good thing if it took more effort? If it was harder to do something kind than to do something mean?\n\nWhich creates an interesting situation – if your nature compels you to do something good, is it more virtuous to purposefully deprogram that compulsion, making you objectively a worse friend for a while, to then reintroduce the same act but consciously?\n\nThat seems an unnecessarily effortful way to finally feel good about doing something kind for other people.\n\nI have no answer here, interesting question though."
