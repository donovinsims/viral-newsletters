I wish I could remember who posted it but I can’t. Thank you for inspiring this essay <3\n\n“Why is it that when I mess up it’s my fault but when other people mess up it’s also my fault?”\n\n**Let’s call this The Atlas Complex.**\n\nIf you care too much about harmony, you end up volunteering to be the scapegoat in every room.\n\nSomeone else snaps at the waiter? You apologise.\n\nA partner forgets an anniversary? You bend yourself into origami explaining how you “should’ve reminded them”.\n\nA project collapses at work? You lie awake replaying how you “could have prevented it,” despite the fact that six other people were asleep at the wheel.\n\nIt’s like walking around with a personal magnet for blame.\n\nPart of this comes from childhood training.\n\nIf your peace at home depended on you keeping everyone else happy, you learned very early that the fastest route to calm was to accept fault, even when it wasn’t yours.\n\nThe problem is that the world happily accepts this bargain.\n\n**If you’re willing to hold the bag, there will always be someone eager to drop theirs into your arms.**\n\nIn Greek myth, Atlas was a Titan who fought against the Olympian gods, and when his side lost Zeus condemned him to hold up the sky for eternity. In life, many of us volunteer for the same sentence. We confuse nobility with needless burden, and we don’t notice the chains because they look like responsibility.\n\n**There is a difference between being kind and seeming kind – one nourishes you, the other erases you.**\n\n\"Good Will Hunting shows a similar pattern. Robin Williams’ character Sean sits across from Will and repeats: “It’s not your fault”. At first, Will laughs it off, then he grows angry, and finally he breaks. Because the most corrosive thing wasn’t his own mistakes, it was carrying the blame for things done to him, things that were never his to own.\"\n\n**Self-esteem can’t grow if every bruise the world leaves on you gets mistaken for a self-inflicted wound.**\n\nThe irony is that people who chronically self-blame often think they’re being noble.\n\n“At least if it’s my fault, I can fix it.”\n\nResponsibility feels like agency.\n\n\"But there’s a dark flip side: if everything is your fault, then nothing is anyone else’s.\"\n\nYou’ve quietly signed a contract absolving the world of its share of the work and that’s not virtue, it’s self-betrayal.\n\nRelationships suffer most under this spell.\n\nWhen one partner absorbs all the blame, the other never learns accountability.\n\nBoundaries aren’t walls; they’re the conditions love needs to survive.\n\n**The way out is not to stop owning your mistakes, that part is beautiful and rare. It’s to let others own theirs too.**\n\nBravery isn’t bowing your head, it’s lifting it and saying, “This one’s not on me”.\n\nThe courage isn’t in denial, it’s in refusing to be Atlas, refusing to absorb the weight of other people’s failures just to keep the peace.\n\nOtherwise you spend your life mopping up after other people’s spills, confusing servitude for strength, and wondering why your shoulders ache all the time.\n\n***\n\n**MODERN WISDOM**\nI do a podcast where I pretend to have a British accent.\n\n**This week’s upcoming episodes:**\n\n*   Monday. Sam Sulek – the fastest growing fitness influencer in the world on his favourite exercises, dealing with pressure, concerns about longevity and whether he’ll do an ASMR channel. Listen now on Spotify and Apple Podcasts.\n*   Thursday. Lionel Page – one of my favourite Substack writers on why humans self-deceive, why is communication so multilayered, how coalitions form and break down.\n*   Saturday. Zack Telander\n\n***\n\n**THINGS I’VE LEARNED**\n\n1.  **Men want a family more than women do.**\n    Gen Z men who voted for Trump rate having children as the most important thing in their personal definition of success.\n    Gen Z women who voted for Harris ranked having children as the second-least important thing in their personal definition of success out of 13 options.\n    Young female Harris voters also ranked emotional stability as the third-most important thing in their personal definitions of success, something that young men who voted for Trump ranked second to last.\n    Men and women who voted for Harris are both more likely to include a “fulfilling job” and “using their talents and resources to help others” in their definitions of success.\n    Men and women who voted for Trump are more likely to list “financial independence”, “having children” and “being spiritually grounded” on their lists of what defines success.\n\n2.  **New jobs are stressful.**\n    Changing jobs is a significant cause of stress, creating on average about a third as much stress as the death of a spouse, half as much as divorce, about the same amount as the death of a close friend, and 50% more than quitting smoking. — Rob Henderson\n\n3.  **If we are unduly absorbed in improving our lives we may forget altogether to live them.**\n    “What you long for won’t come from improving yourself endlessly, it will come from embracing who you truly are.” — Art Of Accomplishment\n\n***"
