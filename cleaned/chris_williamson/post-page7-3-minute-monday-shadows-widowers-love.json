Glad to see you’ve got so much spare time to catch up with them.”\n\nYou’re out for dinner and your partner is on their phone a lot.\n\nWhat you WANT to say is “Hey I’d love to speak and I know you’re busy but it makes me feel really good when you focus on me during dinner, can your phone stuff wait until later?”\n\nWhat you ACTUALLY say is “That’s a very important message to be taking at this time? It’s gotta be really urgent.”\n\nShadow sentences are not stating what you want or need, but instead saying a thing you hope will cause the other person to realise what you need, and then getting upset if they don’t.\n\nYou kind of gesture in the direction of the thing you want without asking for it directly.\n\nIt prevents you from having to be open and vulnerable when it feels like someone else has done something slightly wrong.\n\nIt protects you from rejection by not actually asking for anything.\n\nIt’s the ultimate expression of “if you loved me, you’d know what’s wrong”.\n\nShadow sentences are so toxic because it reduces both parties’ desire to communicate openly, honestly and with vulnerability which becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nThankfully they’re easy to fix by just breaking that cycle, when one person starts speaking openly and carefully, it gives the other person license to do the same thing.\n\nMODERN WISDOM\n\nI do a podcast which has had 500 million+ downloads. You should subscribe on Apple Podcasts or Spotify.\n\nThis week’s upcoming episodes:\n\nJimmy Rex – the reality of what it takes to become a better man. How to integrate emotions, control vices, utilise desire in healthy ways and commit to a purpose.\n\nTHINGS I’VE LEARNED\n\n1.\nWidowers do very poorly.\n\n60% of 60 year old men say their best friend is their wife.\n\nOnly 30% of 60 year old women say their best friend is their husband.\n\n2.\nThe difference between fame, respect and self-respect.\n\n“You don’t want fame, you want respect.\n\nRespect comes from living up to their standards.\n\nYou don’t want respect, you want self-respect.\n\nSelf-respect comes from living up to your own standards.\n\nThe same standards that you apply to other people.” — Naval\n\n3.\nQuestions to help determine if someone is right for you or not.\n\nIf we’re wondering whether someone is right for us or not, here are a set of questions to ask ourselves in order to tease out their true appropriateness.\n\nWe can ask the following of them:\n\n– Can this person apologise for their problematic sides?\n\n– Do they have a keen sense of their flaws?\n\n– Can they accept criticism?\n\n– Are they keen to improve themselves in a psychological sense? Do they know that progress in emotional maturity is desirable or possible?\n\n– Can they say sorry, warmly and generously?\n\n– Can they tolerate flaws, your flaws?\n\n– Do they have a rich interpretive model of where flaws come from?\n\n– Are they curious about the details of your inner life, especially events before you were nine?\n\n– Are they comfortable revealing to you when they are upset? Can they be brave enough to share their disappointments? Can they ask for repair when you damage things inadvertently?\n\n– Can they laugh at themselves and at you with generosity and sympathy at the obvious chaos and disappointment of being human?\n\n– Are they curious about the details of your inner life, especially events before you were nine?\n\n– Are they comfortable revealing to you when they are upset?
