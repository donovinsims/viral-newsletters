Here’s a brief review of their major findings:\n\nBoth gay men and lesbians held more negative views of bisexual persons of the same sex than they did of the other sex.\n\nCompared to lesbians, gay men were more likely to see bisexual men as having an unstable sexual orientation. Likewise, compared to gay men, lesbians were more likely to see bisexual women as having an unstable sexual orientation.\n\nGay men tended to see bisexual men as being “secretly gay,” whereas lesbians tended to see bisexual women as “secretly straight.” In other words, both groups perceived bisexuals (regardless of their sex) as being more attracted to men than to women.\n\nLesbians’ greater negativity toward bisexual women (relative to gay men) was statistically explained by lesbians’ greater tendency to view bisexual women as being primarily attracted to men. By contrast, gay men’s perception of bisexual men as “secretly gay” did not account for why they held more negative attitudes toward bi men than did lesbians.\n\nThese results indicate that not only does bisexual prejudice exist in the gay community, but that there are some interesting gender dynamics at play here. Therefore, if we want to understand the nature of this bias, we can’t collapse across gay men and lesbians in research—we need to look at their attitudes separately.\n\n— h/t Dr Justin Lehmiller\n\n2.  \n**Being the best has outsized rewards.**\n\n“Talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk and combine to reach the needed levels: There’s a premium to being the best.\n\nTherefore, if you’re in a marketplace where the consumer has access to all performers, and everyone’s value is clear, the consumer will choose the very best.\n\nEven if the talent advantage of the best is small compared to the next rung down on the skill ladder, the superstars still win the bulk of the market.” — Cal Newport\n\n3.  \n**Men can be frustrating.**\n\n“There is a very specific cohort of frustrating men.\n\nGuys who have nothing going for them, no drive in life, uncomfortable in their own skin and endlessly miserable keep complaining about women having too-high standards.\n\nBruh your standards for yourself are through the floor.\n\nIf your friends don’t want to hang around with you, if YOU wouldn’t want to hang around with you, why would a woman?” — JohnSmack0"
