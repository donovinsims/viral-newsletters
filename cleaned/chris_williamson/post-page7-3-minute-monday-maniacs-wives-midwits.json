Otherwise known as methamphetamine.\n\nBut this was no normal meth, this was pharmaceutical-quality meth direct from the laboratory. Absolute head-spinning wartime-grade human horsepower.\n\nGiven the purity, you might think that dosing carefully would be a good idea.\n\nWrong.\n**Koivunen consumed the entire supply of Pervitin; enough for 30 men.**\n\nThe subsequent manic burst of energy caused him to pace his squad so aggressively that they outran all of the pursuing forces and the Soviets gave up.\n\nThe rest of Koivunen’s squad realised that he was a danger to himself and everyone else so took his ammunition and knife away.\n\nWhen his team turned around after packing away his possessions, they discovered that Koivunen had disappeared.\n\nKoivunen had entered a state of delirium and after skiing on his own in a random direction for 62 miles, eventually lost consciousness and fell asleep.\n\nHe later recalled waking up the following morning, now separated from his patrol and with no supplies.\n\nAt this point, a Soviet soldier popped out from behind a tree and starts shooting.\n\nKoivunen raises his gun to return fire and discovers that his squad took all his ammunition.\n\nIn a last ditch attempt to save himself, Koivunen hurls his rifle at the soldier and the soldier explodes into a cloud of white.\n\nIt turns out that there was no soldier, it was just a tree branch covered in snow.\n**Koivunen is now hallucinating.**\n\nHe sets off trying to find his comrades and after 2 hours sees his friends’ camp and fire in the distance.\n\nUpon finally arriving, Koivunen realises that he’s not found his team, he’s actually skied directly into a Soviet camp.\n\nChaos ensues and Koivunen escapes the Soviet pursuit again, this time solo.\n\nAfter another full day and night’s skiing he comes across a wooden cabin.\n\nHe starts a fire in the middle of the cabin rather than in the fireplace and lays down to sleep.\n**He wakes up outside the smouldering remains of what used to be his cabin and immediately enters into a fight to the death against a 65lb wolverine using his knife.**\n\nBut he doesn’t have a knife, it turns out he’s used his compass as a weapon, which is now broken.\n\nAnd it wasn’t a wolverine, it was a tree log.\n\nKoivunen is still hallucinating.\n\nHe then chases the North Star for 8 hours straight thinking it’s a fire in the distance.\n\nHe finds an abondoned Forward Observational Base and steps on a landmine left behind by the Germans as a booby trap, blowing up his foot.\n\nDoesn’t die.\n\nDecides to go and investigate the base.\n\nUpon opening the door to the base Koivunen is hit by another booby trap which explodes him and the door 30 yards backward.\n**Koivunen says he spent a full week laid in the snow melting ice to drink in a tiny fire before three Finnish soldiers came upon him.**\n\nOne of which immediately steps on a landmine.\n\nThe other two decide to save their friend rather than Koivunen saying they’ll come back to get him, leaving him all alone again.\n\nDays later, the Finnish soldiers actually do come back to get him and Koivunen is finally saved and transported to a nearby hospital.\n\nIt turned out he had been gone for 14 days and skied more than 400km or 248.5 mi.\n\nDespite it being a full 2 weeks since he took the drugs, Koivunen’s resting heart rate was measured at 200 beats per minute and he weighed only 43 kg (94.8 lbs).\n\nIn the fortnight that he was gone, he subsisted only on pine buds, melted snow and a single Siberian Jay which he beat to death with his ski pole and ate raw.\n\nHe died in 1989 at the age of 71."
