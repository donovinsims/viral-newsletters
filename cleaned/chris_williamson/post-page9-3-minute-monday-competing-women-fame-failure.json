      "content": "Hi friend,\n\nI got in trouble last week for saying that women’s disapproval of sex work was their intrasexual competition at play, trying to control the sexuality of other women.\n\nI think it’s a very fair comment to say that women will likely be more attuned to the suffering of women working in prostitution than men are.\n\nAnd also that women have no incentive to permit it to continue, so their disapproval may be heavily due to their desire to protect these women, whereas men wouldn’t have this impetus.\n\nTo state the obvious – women absolutely can be moral, caring and empathetic so that other females don’t suffer, make errors in life, get hurt by dating mistakes and much more.\n\nBut it’s provably wrong to say that this exclusively comes from a place of ethically-balanced, unselfish moral virtue.\n\n**As a society, we have no issue in pointing out men’s selfishness and many shortcomings.**\n\n**It’s unlikely that women, who are also human beings, have only saintly motives.**\n\nHere are some examples…\n\n**Studies show that women are more likely to express aggression toward women who are dressed more promiscuously, showing more skin.**\n\nThis effect is increased in the presence of men, and reduced when it’s only women around.\n\n**Studies show that women prefer to take appearance-related advice from gay men rather than their female friends.**\n\nThis is because women believe gay men are more likely to be honest, whereas female peers might give less than honest advice to reduce competition.\n\n**Most slut shaming comes from women, not men.**\n\nWhy?\n\n“If one woman offers blowjobs on the second date, it’s harder for other women to keep them in reserve until the fourth date as their special treat.\n\nThis creates a downward spiral of young women feeling like they have to offer more and more sex to more and more guys just to stay in the mating game.\n\nThus, slut-shaming is a way of enforcing a more restrained sexual norm on other women so that not all women have to become more promiscuous than any of them would like.” — Geoffrey Miller & Tucker Max\n\nThink about it – if men had the opportunity to make all women on the planet more horny, do you really believe they’d say no?\n\nIt’s women who lose out when the price of sex drops, thus they are the enforcers of that price.\n\nInterestingly, the claim of “gold digger” can be seen as a different kind of slut shaming.\n\nAka.. “protect yourself from this woman, men, she’s only giving you sex disingenuously to get at your money”.\n\nCalling someone a slut is a sexual infidelity prewarning.\n\nCalling someone a gold digger is an emotional and resource infidelity prewarning.\n\nWhat about abortion?\n\n**Polls consistently show that women are more likely than men to support a reduction on the abortion limit.**\n\n28% of men supported a reduction vs 46% of women. (YouGov 2011)\n\n24% of men vs 49% of women. (YouGov 2012)\n\n35% of men vs 59% of women. (Angus Reid)\n\n“If it were left to women to vote on the issue, with men out of the picture, there’s a good chance that the result would be in favour of restricting abortion.\n\nOn the flip side, if only men voted, they’d almost certainly vote in favour of women’s reproductive rights.” — The Guardian\n\nWhy?\n\nWomen who are pro-life can control the reproductive strategies of other women by taking them off the dating market.\n\nA woman who can have more consequence-free sex is a bigger competitor for mates (even to married and committed women) than one who faces a greater risk of getting pregnant.\n\nThis isn’t to say that arguments for being pro-life don’t come from religious or moral grounds too, but the intrasexual competition is an obvious contributor.\n\n**Age Gap Dating Shaming is another timely example.**\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio went viral again for his new girlfriend being 25 years old.\n\nYou’ll notice that almost all age-gap dating shaming came from women, not from men.\n\nWhy?\n\nProtecting young women from a predatory older man?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nBut also our old friend, female intrasexual competition.\n\nEven though Leo is taking away viable female’s fertile years from other potential male partners, it’s women who have the biggest problem with the age gap, precisely because a young women who can capture an older high status man is a bigger threat to women than she is to men.\n\nBy shaming women into dating within their own age bracket, the dating pool of older, high status men is opened up more and competition is lowered for other women.\n\n**In short – women are great. Huge fan of them. But they can be perversely motivated, petty, vicious and conniving in ways that they are unaware of, and pretending that their behaviour is ubiquitously morally motivated is both false and not useful.**\n\nThe argument that women only tell other women to wear long dresses, leave sex work, support pro-life positions and not have casual sex is exclusively motivated by protection implies that women don’t ever compete with other women.\n\nIf you think that women don’t ever compete with each other and only do these things from a place of helping other women, then you also think that it’s ONLY men who compete with the same sex.\n\nThat implies that women are passive creatures who just let mating happen to them, without competing with other women for access to the best mates.\n\nThat’s a superbly patronising view of women, which disempowers them as agents of their own destiny.\n\nA better view is that, like men, women stand to gain from competing with the same sex for mates.\n\nAnd that they are capable of doing it.\n\nAnd that sometimes competition involves not just being “the best” but also tearing others down or interfering with their mating prospects."
