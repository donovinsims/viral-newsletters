But isn’t that also what makes you thoughtful, receptive, and serious about getting better?\n\nYou say your nervous system never relaxes because your home was unpredictable. But isn’t that also why you’re perceptive, quick-thinking, and never caught off guard?\n\n**The traits you’re most ashamed of are often just the dark side of something light.**\n\nYour sharp edges didn’t appear out of nowhere.
