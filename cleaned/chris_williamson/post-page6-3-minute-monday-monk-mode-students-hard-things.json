      "content": "Hi friend,\n\nI’ve been thinking about The Dark Side Of Monk Mode.\n\nMonk Mode has grown to huge popularity over the last few years as a self-improvement strategy, especially for men.\n\nIt’s a retreat from the world to focus on the 3 I’s – Introspection, Isolation and Improvement.\n\nDespite its recent ascendence, it is nothing new, Illimitable Man was writing about this back in 2014:\n\n“Monk mode is a temporary form of MGTOW, by cutting yourself off from the rest of the world for a while you can fine-tune your focus, calibrate your direction and confront yourself.\n\nYou’ll be acknowledging your weaknesses and then formulating a plan of action to deal with them.”\n\nThe focus is on “minimising your time contribution to social obligations and junk activities because these consume much of your time whilst yielding little to negligible increase towards your social market value.\n\nMonk mode is a serious commitment that is not to be half-assed.\n\nYou’re either doing it, or you’re not.\n\nIt’ll be a struggle in the beginning, but once you’re fully engaged it becomes a beneficial, productive and dare I say even addictive lifestyle.”\n\nI have gone full Monk Mode a number of times in my life, with great success.\n\n2017, 2018, then mid-2019 basically straight through Covid until 2021.\n\nI’ve cut out alcohol for over 2000 days in the last 8 years. Gone 500 days without caffeine. 1500+ sessions of meditation. 5+ years of daily journals filled, 300+ sessions of yin yoga, probably 500+ hours of Stu McGill’s Big 3.\n\nAll done in a bedroom in Newcastle Upon Tyne UK, sat, on my own, usually first thing in the morning.\n\nAlmost all of the most important progress I have ever made was facilitated by a concentrated period like this.\n\nHowever, Monk Mode’s reliable effectiveness creates a problem.\n\nThe dark side is the final two words from IM’s breakdown above…\n\n“Addictive lifestyle.”\n\n**The problem is that Monk Mode justifies a retreat from life, risk taking and adventure as self development.**\n\n**It makes you feel noble in isolation.**\n\nSo much so that it can become hard to bring yourself back out.\n\nThis means that if you already have a tendency to live a sheltered, unsocial life, you’re encouraging yourself to abscond even further away from ever building a real-life support network – the thing which you actually need most in the long run.\n\nI saw this in a friend over a decade ago who was on a fitness journey.\n\nHe was already introverted and socially shy, then his upcoming fitness competition justified 8pm bedtimes, militant routines and the rejection of all social invites.\n\nThe competition came and went, but the routine didn’t change.\n\nIt took years for him to re-venture out into some sense of normality.\n\nThis is largely a personal reflection too.\n\nThe allure of perpetually working on yourself is high.\n\nImprovement is rewarding.\n\n**But if you’re not careful, you can spend the rest of your life focussed on the 3 I’s at the expense of the actual reason you did Monk Mode in the first place – to be able to show up in the world in a better way.**\n\nBill Perkins says that “delayed gratification in the extreme results in no gratification”.\n\nWith Monk Mode, you practise in private so you can perform in public.\n\nPrivate practise in the extreme results in no public performance.\n\n**TLDR: Don’t obsess for too long in solitude for personal growth or you’ll struggle to reintegrate.**\n\nSolution: Periodise. Set a deadline for your Monk Mode to end. 3-6 months is a sweet spot in my experience. Do longer if you’ve not done it before, shorter if you’re further along your journey."
