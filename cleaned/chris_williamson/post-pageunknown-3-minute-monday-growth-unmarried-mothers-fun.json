      "content": "Hi friend,\n\nI spent the last 9 days at a retreat. By far the most intense thing I’ve ever done.\n\nThink of it like Navy SEAL Bootcamp for emotions.\n\nIt’s way too soon for me to explain what I learned, but here’s an idea that came to me when reflecting on my experience…\n\n**The Anorexic Hermit Crab.**\n\nThere’s a kind of hermit crab that dies if it doesn’t find a bigger shell.\n\nIts soft, vulnerable body grows slowly over time, until the shell that once protected it becomes a claustrophobic prison.\n\nWhen this happens, the crab must leave the comfort of its current shell, venture out into the dangerous open, and risk being exposed, naked, unarmored, and killable while it searches for something bigger, something better.\n\nThe crab has no choice as if it delays too long, it will be crushed by its own growth.\n\nThe body will swell; the shell won’t.\n\nThe thing that once kept it safe will start to deform it.\n\n**The hiding place becomes a tomb.**\n\nBut humans have one advantage over crabs – we can choose to stop growing.\n\nWe can choose to keep ourselves small enough to fit inside our old patterns, stay in the wrong shell, pretend we haven’t changed, and fold ourselves into the old shape just one more time.\n\nWe can choose comfort over truth, even if it slowly ruins us.\n\n**It’s easy to mock someone who clings to outdated beliefs or toxic habits, but most of us don’t resist growth because we’re lazy or deluded. We resist because we’re afraid.**\n\nBecause unlike the crab, who simply gets bigger, growth for humans is often voluntary, and worse, it requires the death of our old selves.\n\nEvery real transformation involves a period of vulnerability.\n\nWhen your old shell no longer fits, but you haven’t yet found a new one – that’s The Shedding Chapter.\n\nThat’s where the danger lives.\n\nThe moment when the old response doesn’t serve you anymore, but the new one hasn’t yet solidified.\n\nYou no longer want to shut down during conflict, but your voice still trembles when you speak.\n\nYou want to stop people-pleasing, but guilt claws at you when you set a boundary.\n\nYou want to act like the confident version of yourself, but you’re still haunted by the fear that it’s all pretend.\n\nThis in-between space is terrifying because you have no proof that this new shell will hold.\n\nWhich is why so many people never leave their old one.\n\n**They don’t stop growing because they’re flawed, they stop growing because growth makes them vulnerable, and vulnerability means pain.**\n\nSo they become anorexic hermit crabs.\n\nShrinking themselves, starving their needs, suppressing their instincts.\n\nThey become too scared to want more, because wanting demands becoming.\n\nThey wear the same identity for a decade. Still the funny one. Still the reliable one. Still the lone wolf. Still the hard worker.\n\nNot because it’s true, but because it fits.\n\nBecause no one questions it.\n\nBecause stepping out of that shell would mean enduring the awful moment where their new self gets laughed at, or worse, ignored.\n\nAnd yet, what they’re afraid of isn’t failure, it’s exposure.\n\nThey fear being seen trying.\n\n**To try is to admit there’s something you want, and to want is to admit you don’t have it yet, and if you don’t have it yet then maybe you’re not enough.**\n\nSo instead, they stay in the old shell.\n\nOld beliefs. Old identity. Old coping mechanisms.\n\nBetter to be secure in a suffocating version of yourself than to be uncertain in a more expansive one.\n\nBut there’s a cost.\n\nYou can lie to your desires, but they don’t stop whispering, they just go quiet and bitter.\n\n**You’ll start to envy people who take risks, not because they always win, but because they had the guts to show up unarmored.**\n\nYou’ll criticise others for being naive, impulsive, arrogant, but really you’re just allergic to your own dormant potential.\n\nAnd eventually, like the crab, if you don’t grow, you don’t survive.\n\nNot physically but spiritually, emotionally and creatively.\n\nYou become safe and dead.\n\nAlive, but not really living.\n\n“Let go or be dragged.” — Oliver Burkeman\n\n(h/t Josh Waitzkin & George Mack)"
