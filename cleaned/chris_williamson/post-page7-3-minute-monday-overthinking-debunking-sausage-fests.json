      "content": "1.  **Debunking six popular science myths.**\n\n1. Contrary to popular opinion, people aren’t working longer hours these days than they did in the past.  In a new paper titled “Cheap Thrills: The Price of Leisure and the Global Decline in Work Hours,” Alexandr Kopytov and colleagues show that Americans today work an average of around 2,000 hours a year.  In 1900, they worked an average of 3,000. Meanwhile, real wages per hour worked have increased 10-fold, and the real price of recreation has dropped by more than half.  Thus, we work less but are paid more, and can purchase twice as much fun per dollar.\n\n2. Are millennials less wealthy than baby boomers were at the same age, as we often hear?  Or are millennials actually wealthier than boomers?  The answer seems to be yes… to both questions.  A recent paper found that the poorest millennials are poorer than the poorest boomers were – but that the wealthiest millennials are also wealthier than were the wealthiest boomers.  This is because the returns to middle-class occupations have increased, whereas the returns to working-class occupations have slumped.\n\n3. In the wake of Islamist terrorist attacks, people often worry about anti-Muslim backlash.  The worry makes perfect sense, and backlash sometimes happens.  Surprisingly, though, it often doesn’t.  Indeed, two months after the terrorist attacks of September 11 2001, the average American actually felt warmer toward Muslim Americans than they had done before them.\n\n4. According to conventional wisdom, European colonialists drew up African national borders thoughtlessly and arbitrarily.  Apparently, though, it’s not true.  On the contrary, in the pursuit of their self-interested goals, colonialists negotiated with local leaders, and learned as much as they could about historical borders and current circumstances, before making any decisions.\n\n5. Contrary to the common belief that the rich don’t pay any taxes, the wealthiest 1% of Americans now pay nearly half of all income taxes, and more than the bottom 95% put together.\n\n6. Many believe that global inequality is rapidly increasing: Rich countries are getting richer, while poor ones are getting poorer.  In many important domains, however, global inequality is actually declining.\n\n—huge h/t Steve Stewart-Williams\n\n2.  **Human life without healthcare was brutal.**\n\nPrior to the emergence of modern medicine, the average mortality rate was roughly 25% for infants and 40–50% for children across human evolution.\n\nThat is, nearly half of our would-be ancestors did not survive to reproductive age.\n\n3.  **Sausage Fests are underpriced.**\n\n“If you invite 40 girls it’s a party.
