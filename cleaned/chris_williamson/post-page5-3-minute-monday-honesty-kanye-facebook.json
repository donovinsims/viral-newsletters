So here we go.\n\n**1. When was the last time you heard them change their mind?**\n\nIf no amount of evidence would change someone’s opinion, then they don’t hold a rational opinion, they hold an ideological belief.\n\nAll of the thinkers I respect the least see changing their opinions as tantamount to destruction of their sense of self.\n\nWhen your ego and your stances have fused so tightly that you can no longer separate them, you will become less and less objective.\n\nIf someone doesn’t regularly alter their opinions, they’re either an unserious thinker, or a deity.\n\n**2. Do they primarily identify out-groups as a mode of bonding their in-group together?**\n\nStraight out of The Charlatan Playbook.\n\nLeaning into tribal biases is a fast-track to getting people on your side.\n\nHumans are naturally super-tribal, so manifesting an enemy group to galvanise everyone to battle against will be superbly effective at encouraging affiliation.\n\nHowever bonding together over the mutual distaste of an out-group is inherently fragile because everyone is only bonded because the enemy of their enemy is a friend.\n\nAnd a Purity Spiral will begin where in order to continue to bond the group together, heretics who don’t conform to the in-group ideology will be identified and shamed.\n\nCheck whether you love the work of the people you look up to, or if you just hate the people who hate them.\n\n**3. How often do they admit mistakes? Genuinely not performatively.**\n\nOpenness and vulnerability is a costly signal.\n\nIt means that the person you’re following cares more about being accurate than seeming perfect.\n\nThey’re prepared to identify their own blindspots in service of being honest.\n\nPerformative mistake-porn is a tool that smart charlatans can use to pretend that they’re owning up to a mistake but it’s all a smoke screen so people can’t accuse them of being too hubristic.\n\n**4. Do they want to hear alternative points of view for reasons other than mocking them?**\n\nRelated to all of the above.\n\nIf their entire body of work is an echo chamber where the only divergent voices are ones that they speak to in order to make them feel silly, galvanise out-group hatred or simply for clickbait, they’re not concerned with the truth.\n\nNot only is it important for your, and their learning, to be exposed to different opinions, but it’s also important to show that you can talk to people who you disagree with without turning it into the sort of slanging match that everyone hates about the internet.\n\nI’m sure there’s other common trends I’ve missed but this seems to be a good start for judging people’s intentions.\n\nIt’s also a set of rules I really need to keep aware of myself both as a consumer and a creator – I’m far from perfect."

You helped to curb my fear of opening up publicly. Thank you."
