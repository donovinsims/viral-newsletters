What do I do that I don’t think is productive but actually is?**\n\nThese were surprisingly easy to work out.\n\n1. Sitting at my desk when I’m not working, being on calls with no actual objective, keeping Slack notifications at zero, sitting on email trying to get the Unread number down.\n\n2. Saying yes to a random dinner when someone is coming through town, organising meet-ups with friends from different social groups, walking without anything in my ears, reading, visiting new places.\n\nAfter 6 months of reflecting on my answers, I realised I’d had a fundamental oversight – I hadn’t been properly linking inputs to outcomes.\n\n**I had basically created a Productivity Rain Dance.**\n\n**This odd, sacred, mystical series of hoops I made myself jump through in the hopes that something useful would come out on the other side, with no real assessment of what fruits it actually bore.**\n\nI’m doing*the thing that looks like work*so that’s good right?\n\nSitting at my desk LOOKS a lot like work, even if I’m tapped out for the day and it’s 6.30pm so I’m guilt-watching UFC knockout compilations. But look – here I am at my desk grinding*it*out!\n\nHow can I go for a walk or lie on the couch when there’s still tons of stuff to do? Tasks Christopher! Think of the tasks!\n\nThe problem is that no one’s productivity goal is to maximise inputs, it’s to maximise outcomes.\n\nA focus on inputs over outcomes can cause you to be blind to higher leverage, more effective approaches to solve the problems you’re facing.\n\n“There are so many people working so hard and achieving so little.” — Andy Groves (seeing directly into my soul)\n\nBeing process driven is great, thank you James Clear for your service.\n\nBut obsessing over process while being detached from outcomes gives you all the pain of hard work with none of the actual results.\n\nBeing effective > looking busy.\n\nWe are applying an industrial revolution mindset to a space-age work environment.\n\nSo…\n\n**What do you do that you think is productive but isn’t?**\n\n**What do you do that you don’t think is productive but actually is?**"
