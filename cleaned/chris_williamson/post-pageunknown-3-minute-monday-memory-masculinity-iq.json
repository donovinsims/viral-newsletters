Later he gets placed in a lineup and is identified by the victim as the man who had assaulted her.\n\nThomson was stunned and said it couldn’t have been him as he had been live on television at the time of the assault.\n\nThe policeman taking his statement scoffed at his alibi, replying “Yes, I suppose you’ve got Jesus Christ, and the Queen of England, too.”\n\nThe police knew that the victim had been assaulted. They had DNA and photo evidence, as well as her statement, plus she had categorically identified Thomson as her attacker in the lineup.\n\nIt seemed like a slam dunk.\n\nBut there was a wrinkle – investigators learned that the attacker had entered the woman’s home at the exact same time as the show Thomson claimed to be on was airing.\n\nOnly then did they realise the victim’s mistake.\n\nThe attacker had assaulted the woman as she was watching TV—the very program on which Thompson had appeared.\n\nIt turned out she had confused memory sources.\n\nShe had been watching Thomson’s TV interview shortly before the attack; later, her traumatised mind merged Thomson’s face (seen on TV) with the memory of the assaulter.\n\nThomson was eventually cleared – but his case became a famous example of how convincing yet false memories can land an innocent person in jail.\n\nAn eyewitness identification, even given with total confidence, may be completely wrong if memory mixes up time, place, or faces.\n\nThe kicker? Thomson was on TV to discuss an area of particular expertise he had as a psychologist – specifically the unreliability of eyewitness memory."
