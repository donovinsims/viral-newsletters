  "text": "i fully believe that the average guy making $10k-$50k/month online is in a better position to teach someone making $0 how to get to $10k/month...\n\nthan a billionaire like jeff bezos or elon musk is to teach someone starting from $0 how to get to $10k/month\n\nthey have been at a completely different level for so long that they'd be clueless as to how the ground level works - it's a completely different game, definitely a significantly easier one, but still mostly foreign to them\n\nmost advice from billionaires that you'd find online or in their books is shit like \"work hard, focus on changing the world, etc.\"\n\nyou'll get more hands-on action steps from people a level above you than guys on level 100",
