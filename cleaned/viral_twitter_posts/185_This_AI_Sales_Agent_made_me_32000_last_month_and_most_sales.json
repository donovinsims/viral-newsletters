  "text": "This AI Sales Agent made me $32,000 last month and most sales teams have no idea it exists\n\nwhile your competitors let 73% of warm leads go cold after the first call, this system turns every conversation into a revenue-generating follow-up machine\n\nupload your CRM and it scans past replies, objections, and call transcripts then sends context-aware follow-ups written in your exact tone\n\nhere's what it does:\n\n– pulls pain points and objections from call transcripts via Fireflies\n– uses GPT-4 to generate 5-step follow-up sequences based on actual pain points\n– writes emails like a founder, not a generic sales bot\n– detects replies in real-time and stops sequences instantly\n– stores everything in unified CRM threads via Airtable\n– runs 24/7 without human intervention\n\ntakes 15 minutes to set up, no code required, runs forever\n\nwhile other sales teams manually track leads in spreadsheets, this automates the entire follow-up process\n\nFollow + RT + comment \"AGENT\" and I'll DM you the complete workflow + automation setup for FREE\n\nskip this and keep watching 73% of your warm leads disappear into Gmail graveyard",
