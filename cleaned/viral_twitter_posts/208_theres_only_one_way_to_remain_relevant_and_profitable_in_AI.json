  "text": "there's only one way to remain relevant and profitable in AI...\n\nand it's REALLY important, so listen to this\n\nobsessing over \"mastering\" ChatGPT, Sora, or ElevenLabs will take you nowhere, it's a completely wrong approach\n\nsimply because we're in a market that changes every 3 months:\n> new model drops\n> everyone's mind is blown\n> old workflows are obsolete\n> you're back to square one\n\nif you're trying to become \"very good\" at THIS specific tool... you're already behind because by the time you master it, there's a better one\n\nthe tools are temporary... the skills are permanent, here's what actually keeps you relevant:\n\ndevelop AI skills that transcend the tools:\n- prompt engineering principles\n- AI workflow design (when to use AI vs when not to)\n- quality control systems (catching hallucinations, maintaining consistency)\n- integration thinking (connecting multiple AIs into one system)\n\nthese skills transfer, no matter what model launches next month... you can adapt in hours, not months\n\nyour agency stays profitable because you're not tied to one tool - you're building systems that work regardless of which AI is \"winning\" this quarter",
