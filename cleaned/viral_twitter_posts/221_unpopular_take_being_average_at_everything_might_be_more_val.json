  "text": "unpopular take: being average at everything might be more valuable than being excellent at one thing...\n\nin the AI era at least, here's why:\n\nAI amplifies what you already know... it doesn't replace foundational understanding\n\n> if can't code? vibe coding won't work in production\n> if can't write copy? AI landing page converts like shit\n> if you have zero sense for design? AI logos will suck\n\nso if you're exceptional at coding... you'll build exceptional SaaS with AI\n\nbut if that's your only skill? you'll fail at marketing, distribution, and make $0\n\nbeing average at multiple things combined with strong AI skills = more quality work than most specialists\n\nthis is just a take I'm processing... might reflect differently next week, but I'm seeing this pattern everywhere\n\nthe people winning aren't the deepest experts, they're competent across multiple domains and know how to direct AI in each\n\nbeing \"jack of all trades\" used to be a weakness, now it might be the ultimate advantage\n\nwhat's your take on this?",
