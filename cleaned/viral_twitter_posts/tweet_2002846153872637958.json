  "text": "one of the biggest psyops social media has surfaced is that there's people out there who are truly locked in 24/7...\n\ni know some absolute killers & most of them do things that you'd imagine as \"unproductive\" for a large part of their day - e.g. scrolling social media, playing games, etc.\n\nbelieve me when i tell you that NOBODY is locked in 24/7 - even elon finds time to shitpost, watch tv shows & play games\n\nif you can make 5 hours of your day translate into some form of measurable progress then you're literally ahead of 99.99% of the worlds population on that given day",
