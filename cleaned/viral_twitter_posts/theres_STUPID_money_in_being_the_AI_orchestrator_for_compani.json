  "text": "there's STUPID money in being the AI orchestrator for companies\n\nmost of you are missing this goldmine because you're stuck selling $500/month zapier workflows\n\nhere's what i mean:\ncompanies are dying to use AI but 99% of employees just dump random thoughts into ChatGPT and wonder why it sucks\n\nthe opportunity? \n\ncreate sophisticated AI systems that regular employees can actually operate\n\nexample: we help brands scale on LinkedIn with content\n\nnormally you'd hire a ghostwriter for $3K/month (vet them, create SOPs, pray they don't mess up your brand voice)\n\ninstead i built AI ghostwriter systems - think Claude projects with comprehensive context profiles, brand voice training, validation workflows\n\none employee operates the entire system and produces output that rivals top-tier freelancers\n\nthe business model is so powerful because you're not selling another automation\n\nyou're selling AI-powered employee capabilities that didn't exist before\n\ncompanies will pay $5K-15K/month for systems that actually work vs broken workflows they have to babysit\n\nmost businesses are completely bamboozled by AI implementation because they're stuck in the \"prompt engineering\" mindset \n\nwhen what they actually need is systematic AI integration that their existing teams can leverage\n\nthis isn't about selling another workflow automation - it's about creating AI-powered employee capabilities that didn't exist before\n\nsmart operators are building AI infrastructure that turns regular employees into specialists\n\nthis isn't about replacing people - it's about systematic AI integration at the operational level\n\nthe market is massive because 99% of companies know they need AI integration\n\nbut have no framework for actually implementing it at an operational level",
