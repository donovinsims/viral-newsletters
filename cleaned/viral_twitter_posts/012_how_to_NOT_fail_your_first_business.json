  "text": "how to NOT fail your first business:\n\n- stop setting up stupid tools (notion workspace, CRM...) that don't generate revenue\n- making your website & logo your #1 priority is a trap\n- put ALL your energy into generating leads\n- deliver a service so good that customers physically can't leave\n- don't even THINK about scaling for the first 3 months\n- never hire cheap contractors\n- do it yourself first, THEN delegate\n- focus on ONE offer and execute it relentlessly until it's easy\n- never sell your time\n- never sell cheap, it attracts nightmare clients\n- say what you'll do, then do what you said\n- invest early cash in infrastructure that prepares you for scale later on\n- build strong onboarding flows\n- focus obsessively on your clients and they'll make you more $ than any cold outreach ever will",
