  "text": "Claude + MCP + Perplexity = AI Proposal Engine that closed $8,500 last week...\n\n(from one sales call transcript)\n\n→ No more 4+ hours writing proposals manually\n→ No more generic templates that sound like everyone else\n→ No more deals dying in the proposal stage\n→ No more missing critical buying signals from calls\n\nJust one call transcript → precision-targeted proposal that closes.\n\nHere's how it works:\n→ Transcript Intelligence Engine (pulls calls from Airtable automatically)\n→ Buying Signal Extraction (spots real pain points with sniper precision)\n→ Live Research Integration (Perplexity finds strengthening context)\n→ Narrative Generation System (writes in your voice and structure)\n→ Document Assembly Engine (styled Google Doc ready to send)\n→ One-Shot Deployment (fully autonomous proposal creation)\n→ Precision Targeting (hits exact prospect psychological triggers)\n\nBuilt with MCP agent architecture.\nRuns autonomously without supervision.\n15-minute setup. Insane accuracy.\n\nResults so far:\n• $8,500 closed from single transcript\n• 4+ hours → 10 minutes proposal time\n• \"Most comprehensive strategy document ever received\"\n• Zero manual work, pure precision targeting\n\nWant the complete system blueprint?\nLike + comment \"SNIPER\" + repost, and I'll DM it to you.\n(must be following)",
