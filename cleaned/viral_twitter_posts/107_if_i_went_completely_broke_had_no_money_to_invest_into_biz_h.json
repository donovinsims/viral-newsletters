  "text": "if i went completely broke & had no money to invest into biz, here's what i'd do to start making a decent income online...\n\ni'd go to the whop discover page & find some whops that are performing well - making sure that they're in high-value niches (e.g. trading, sportsbetting, bizopp)\n\nwhen you look up a certain keyword on the discover page, you'll automatically be shown some of the top-perfoming whops within that niche\n\nat this point you'll want to look up their socials and reverse engineer their organic strategy\n\nwhen you find a whop that is killing it organically & also has good affiliate commissions, you'll basically want to create \"alt\" accounts for them & replicate their content\n\nthis content will promote the whop & drive traffic towards the referral link...\n\nbut here's the real sauce - you should add an \"alternate channel\" in the funnel, this can be for example, an email list or a telegram channel\n\nyou need to have a way of storing the traffic, that way you're not just sending them to an affiliate link & letting them run away if they don't convert...\n\nthis alternate channel will become a super useful asset in the future when you want to promote your own whop in the same niche\n\nin short, you're:\n> finding a whop that's doing well, is in a high-value niche & has a good affiliate commission\n> reverse engineering their organic content strategy\n> replicating it & sending the traffic to a newsletter or a telegram channel\n> shilling your affiliate link within that channel alongside related sauce",
