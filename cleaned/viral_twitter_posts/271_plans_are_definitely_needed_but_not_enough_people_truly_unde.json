  "text": "plans are definitely needed, but not enough people truly understand that the path becomes clearer as you walk it...\n\nnothing i have ever planned unfolded exactly the way i envisioned it\n\nyes these plans turned into successful projects, but the difference between the \"plan\" & the finished product is always much different\n\nideas automatically adapt to the obstacles / insights that come up as you start summoning them into reality & it's pretty hard to account for all these things in your mind as you're planning - it's best to tackle them as they come & get that experience under your belt\n\nin other words, the best way to figure out the best way of doing something... is to do it, lol",
