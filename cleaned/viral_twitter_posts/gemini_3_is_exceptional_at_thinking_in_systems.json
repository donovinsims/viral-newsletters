  "text": "gemini 3 is exceptional at thinking in systems...\n\nhere's how i found out:\n\ni run an SEO agency, 90% of client delivery is handled by automations\n\nit's been a while since i actually improved these systems... beyond just upgrading models, i mean\n\nso i fed gemini 3 everything:\n- business context\n- what we're achieving\n- the complete workflow\n- every tool we use\n\nused this dead-simple prompt:\n\"analyze this workflow, find flaws, cost-saving opportunities and quality improvements\"\n\nit thought for a bit... then gave me a ridiculously practical to-do list\n\nwhat surprised me is how it's so good at using tools to catch small details that have huge impact\n\ni tried the changes... quality went up & speed went up\n\ni used it on keyword research using ahrefs + perplexity and gemini's new system found smart keywords i would have missed",
