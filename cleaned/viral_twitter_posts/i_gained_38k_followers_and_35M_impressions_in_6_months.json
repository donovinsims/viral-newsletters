  "text": "i gained 38k followers and 35M+ impressions in 6 months...\n\nhere's the exact process i used to write 7 tweets per day in 30 minutes:\n\nlook, i don't like forcing creative work, sitting at my desk hoping my brain magically produces tweet ideas sucks\n\nso i stopped trying (never really tried)\n\ninstead... i just scribble down whatever happens during my day in a notebook, then turn those thoughts into formatted tweets in the evening\n\nthe easiest way to produce content in volume is simple: DO things\n\nif you're learning something new every day, solving problems, doing cool shit... it's really not complicated to turn your life into tweets\n\nhere's how you can do the same:\n\nspend more time exploring new concepts and talk about what you're learning - this works because you tap into genuine questions people have as they're learning the same stuff\n\nyou're not pretending to be an expert... you're just sharing what clicked for you\n\ndocument your business: systems you set up, problems your clients have, workflows that worked - this works because you define yourself as an authority and connect with people facing the same challenges\n\nshitpost - it's easy to tweet about random stuff that comes to mind\n\nthe whole process should feel natural: scribble down thoughts on paper as things happen and then scratch your head a little to turn raw observations into polished tweets\n\nthat's it\n\nask yourself \"what did o figure out today that someone else might find useful?\"",
