  "text": "if i had to start an AI agency today, here's exactly what i'd do:\n\n1. spend the first month building dead-simple systems using plug & play\ntools like n8n (no fancy custom code, just functional workflows that work)\n\n2. focus exclusively on content creation automation: UGC, ads, faceless channels, SEO workflows - the systems businesses desperately need but don't know how to build\n\n3. learn by actually doing the work and having AI help me debug\nspend real time fixing what breaks, not giving up when something doesn't work immediately\n\n4. start creating content showing exactly what i'm building\nshare my systems publicly, drop lead magnets on X, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok\n\n5. inbound would flood in naturally\nfrom there, my offer designs itself because people are literally asking me daily for specific systems they need (let the market tell you what to sell)\n\n6. deliver everything myself for the first 3-6 months to really understand the service...\nthen hire to scale once i've proven the systems work and know exactly what good delivery looks like (you can't delegate what you don't understand)",
