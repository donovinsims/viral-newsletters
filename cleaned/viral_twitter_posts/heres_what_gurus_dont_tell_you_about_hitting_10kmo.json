  "text": "here's what gurus don't tell you about hitting $10k/mo...\n\n$10k per month is the first milestone for most people... and yeah, it changes your life, lets you live basically anywhere on the planet\n\nbut listen...\n\nonce you hit 10k/mo, it's surprisingly easy to just maintain it at that level\n\nmost of the work becomes maintenance... keeping customers happy\n\nand this is where people get stuck\n\nyou fall into complacency... satisfied with the money, never pushing to actually scale\n\nnever making the move to the next level - you need to escape this phase immediately\n\nhaving a revenue number as your only goal will leave you empty once you hit it\n\nif you're chasing net worth (which is stupid btw), you have to move to the next target fast\n\ndon't let comfort kill your momentum",
