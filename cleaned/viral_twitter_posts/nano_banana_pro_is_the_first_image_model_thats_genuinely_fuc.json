  "text": "nano banana pro is the first image model that's genuinely fucking with my head...\n\ni used to be part of the guys who could clock an AI image in 2 seconds flat\n\n\"too smooth, lighting's wrong, artifacts in the corners\" - whatever, it was obvious\n\nbut for the past few days i've caught myself zooming into photos, double-checking sources, genuinely unsure\n\non one hand: incredible opportunity\n\nyou can build systems, create content, leverage this tech in ways that print money\n\non the other hand... we just lost the ability to trust our eyes\n\nevery image is now suspect and every photo needs a second look\n\nwe spent years worrying about fake news text...\n\nand now the images are indistinguishable from reality\n\nthe opportunity is here, but so is the need to be careful about what you believe\n\nthat's the weird paradox we're living in now (and it's just getting started)",
