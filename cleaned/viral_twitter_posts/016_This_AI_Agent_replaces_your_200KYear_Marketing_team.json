  "text": "This AI Agent replaces your $200K/Year Marketing team\n\nwhile I was eating shawarma at 2am, it scraped 6 platforms, analyzed 73 comment threads, and handed me 9 deploy-ready scripts.\n\nIt stalks your niche, steals what’s working, and turns it into viral content built to print attention.\n\nhere’s what the system does:\n\n– scrapes TikTok, IG, LinkedIn, YouTube, FB, and Twitter\n– finds breakout trends, emotional triggers, and dopamine hooks\n– maps audience avatars + repurposing angles\n– generates platform-native scripts with hooks, CTAs, SEO intros\n– formats everything into a deploy-ready content playbook\n\nno more brainstorming. no more “what should we post today?”\n\nit’s like giving your intern the mind of Alex Hormozi - on a 400mg caffeine drip.\n\nthe workflow includes:\n\n- Multi-platform scraper engine\n- Viral comment sentiment analyzer\n- GPT-powered creative generator\n- Smart repurposing module\n- Auto-formatted Google Docs output\n\nthis isn’t ChatGPT with a cute prompt.\n\nit’s a weaponized idea machine.\n\nif you’re serious about content — and tired of guessing — this flips the game.\n\nComment “ENGINE” + repost this + follow me\nI'll DM you everything in the next hour\n\nskip this, and go back to scheduling posts that get 4 likes.",
