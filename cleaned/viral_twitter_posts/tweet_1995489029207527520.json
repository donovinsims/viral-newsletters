  "text": "you need to lock in for 6 months to change your life...\n\nand it's not a myth, it's backed by science... here's how it works:\n\nthe \"6-month rule\" is real, not just a motivational bullshit... it's grounded in the timelines of human physiology and psychology\n\nobviously there isn't a magic switch that flips at 180 days, but science says that 6 months is the threshold of stability\n\nit works for anything:\n- habits\n- metabolism\n- business...\n\n180 days is the point where a new behavior is established to the new standard...\n\nthe most direct scientific backing comes from the transtheoretical model of behavior change (basically a framework used by psychologists to study how ppl change)\n\nthey're mostly saying that before 6 months, the risk of relapse is highest and the effort required too... however, after 6 months you enter the maintenance stage: things become natural and your chances of \"failing\" decrease\n\nin the case of changing your body (can be anything from big weight loss to bulking for a body competition), 6 months is often when the invisble becomes visible...\n\nin the case of deep changes in your brain (rewiring your thinking), it's more about dopamine... it all starts with a 90-day hard wall: 3 months for your dopa receptors to begin normalizing the new thing you're doing or the old habit you quit\n\nafter 90 days, you're at a weird stage where you're not relying on motivation to move forward anymore... but you're still in the trenches, fighting against what you're trying to change\n\nby 6 months, the part of the brain responsible for willpower and long-term planning (prefrontal cortex) becomes much better at controlling the basal ganglia (the part responsible for impulsive habits)\n\nyou literally have a stronger mind, getting closer to being a chad\n\nwhen it comes to business or leaning a high-income skill, it works the same... you need 800-100hrs to become good enough to be dangerous with a skill, which is about 4hrs of focus for 6 months\n\nso yeah, this whole 6-month rule is real, it works.. simply because it is long enough to survive the valley of despair, but short enough to set a realistic target",
