  "text": "here's a whop affiliate method that you can start right now:\n\nfind creators on whop whose selling point is specific knowledge (e.g. trading, marketing, biz, etc.)\n\nreverse engineer how they currently distribute their content - most of the traffic will almost always come from just 1-2 distribution channels\n\nhere are the 3 most popular ones in my experience:\n- youtube\n- paid ads\n- twitter\n\nyou're gonna wanna isolate the whops that are getting most of their traffic from YT & make sure they're not already posting on X\n\nfor all the whops which are driving traffic from YT, you're gonna wanna extract all of their video transcripts & throw them into gemini\n\nask gemini to extract all of the key pieces of information behind what they're teaching into a bullet point list\n\nnow you're gonna go to claude & turn this bullet point list into a \"tweet idea generator\" claude skill by using claudes built-in \"skill-builder\" skill\n\nsimply give it the bullet point list & add some instructions on how to go about generating ideas - i'd drop the exact prompt but i'm sure you're smart enough to figure it out\n\nafter the claude skill is made, set up an X account for their whop (don't make it branded, branded accs on X flop hard imo)\n\nuse the skill to generate ideas for lead magnets that you can make & turn into a \"reply for X\" automation - if the lead magnet idea is good these will always bang with the right push\n\nonce you have your lead magnet ready, here's the most critical part...\n\nfind an X account in the same niche as the whop you're aff'ing for, make sure it has decent engagement (avg. 5k+ views) & pay them to engage with your first few tweets\n\nthis initial engagement will be critical in giving your post the boost it needs initially to take off by itself\n\nfrom now on your strategy is:\n- 1 lead magnet a day\n- include affiliate link to the whop in each magnet\n- close people in DM's for extra $\n- funnel traffic to an email list or telegram channel\n\nif you do this right, you should have no issue in clearing $10k months\n\ni'd expand more on each point but then i'd be here all day & unfortunately this isn't a paid infoproduct...\n\nif you're stuck on any part, send the part you're confused about to an LLM to get a more detailed explanation",
