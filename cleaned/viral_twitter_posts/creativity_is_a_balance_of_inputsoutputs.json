  "text": "creativity is a balance of inputs/outputs\n\ni don't know a single creative person who doesn't consume a shitton of content - whether that's books, videos, tweets, podcasts, etc.\n\nif you grew up in a empty room w/ just a book & a pen, with zero access to any \"inputs\", you'd have absolutely nothing to write about\n\nthe greatest habit you can adopt to 100x your creativity is to frequently cycle between consumption & creation",
