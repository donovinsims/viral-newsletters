  "text": "had a conversation with a friend today, he is a \"guru\" on IG...\n\nwe talked about the fact that on IG you've gotta sell to the low-level lifestyle gooners, AKA \"wantrepreneurs\"\n\nwhereas on X, you're kinda selling services TO the gurus\n\nin other words, people on X know exactly what you're doing, so you've gotta make your offer good or they'll see through the bullshit\n\nanyone who complains about high market sophistication on X, is basically saying \"my offer is intended for a low-level crowd\"\n\nand they're right, they won't see much success tryna sell that shit here\n\nbut there's a lot of very serious people on this app\n\nif you have an offer that'll actually be beneficial to them, you WILL make a lot of money, no doubt about it",
