  "text": "the easiest way to make progress in anything is volume:\n\nthis is the exact approach i had with this twitter account... i just posted 7-10 tweets a day for 7 months and look at the results now\n\n3 reasons why volume is mandatory:\n- you need minimum viable volume to know if it works\n- being seen creates opportunities you didn't plan for\n- adopting the scientist mindset means you need data to improve\n\neveryone wants the \"perfect strategy\" & nobody wants to do 100 reps to find it\n\njust do the work, collect the data and then make it better",
