  "text": "12 months ago i was surviving on tuna cans in Dubai\n\nthis was the disgusting 12m² apartment I got kicked out for unpaid rent\n\ntoday I'm making $62K+/month from AI & live wherever I want\n\nin September 2024, i paid $4,000 to flew to Dubai for Hassan Haider's mastermind thinking I'd network for 3 days and go home\n\nwhat happened next was the most unhinged year of my life\n\non day 1 I had a Closer Cartel sales interview at 12 AM Dubai time while staying at Paramount Hotel\n\n1 AM: went to the balcony and met two men in their 40s\n\nfirst time I'd ever talked to actual millionaires\n\nthey had yachts, showed me pictures with Real Madrid footballers, chain smoking on the top floor bars until 4 AM\n\nas a naive kid fresh out of college, i was completely enchanted by these guys\n\nthey gave me the \"sell me this pen\" test on the spot - i remember nailing it half drunk lmao\n\nthey were impressed enough to spend hours with me, showing off their lifestyle, promising rolexes, talking about making me rich\n\nafter ONE conversation with these strangers, my 21-year-old brain made the most impulsive decision of my life: abandoned my entire US setup to move to Dubai permanently\n\nand join them on their venture of 'commodity trading'\n\ni thought i'd found my ticket to the top\n\ni didn't even attend a single mastermind event I paid $4,000 originally for\n\nmy parents lost their fucking minds\n\nthe household was in complete chaos for months\nthought I was getting scammed by \"retarded people\" I'd just met\n\nthe honeymoon phase in dubai lasted exactly 14 days.\n\nthen reality hit...\n\nthese \"mentors\" were complete amateurs\n\none was an alcoholic who'd be supportive one day, then threaten me the next\nwould threaten me over 200 dirhams ($50)\nconvinced me to invest my entire $4,000 net worth in commodity trading\ntold me he had CIA connections who'd \"take me down\"\n\nas a 21-year-old dependent on visa sponsorship, these threats felt like death sentences\n\na year later, still haven't seen that money back\n\nspent months trying to broker copper cathode, crude oil, gold deals worth tens of thousands\nthinking I'd make $50K commissions that would solve everything\nnone of the deals ever closed\njust endless paperwork leading nowhere\n\nwe were all inexperienced amateurs pretending to be commodity traders\n\nthe survival period was insane\n\nmy relationship w/ the landlord broke down when I couldn't pay rent\nfor 2-3 weeks, i survived on 1-2 cans of tuna daily\nlost 22 pounds, went from 67kg to 57kg\n\nall my credit cards were over limits, all debit accounts negative, rent in dallas was overdue\n\nliterally \"live or die trying\" mentality\n\nfor 3 days couldn't even go back to my place\nhad to go to bars and pick up different women just to have somewhere to sleep\none from Iran, one from Eastern Europe, third i don't remember\n\nmeanwhile i'm still trying everyday to make cash - training people at the gym, doing random gigs for anything get money in\n\nyet funnily enough\n\ndespite being financially broke, i somehow maintained access to exclusive social circles\n\nwould be invited to private superyachts with 7 millionaires and 30-40 Russian, Ukrainian, Swedish supermodels\nprivate mansion parties in Marina Bay\n\nthe contrast i'd see on a day by day was surreal:\n\none day surviving on tuna cans, next day in the burj khalifa at 3am at a girls place overlooking the business bay, then 4 hours later, i'm in my shoebox room\n\nthe entire experience in dubai definitely taught me more lessons about life than i ever would watching a podcast or reading a book\n\ni learnt that personal energy & charisma matter more than financial status\n\nif i could access the highest social circles while being completely broke, then what can i not do?\n\nmeanwhile, I was working remotely for Ticketmaster with massive timezone conflicts - getting warnings for poor performance daily. I wasn't even showing up to team meetings because I'd fuck off to random establishments to connect with people and try to make something happen\n\nif I'd been fired, would've lost my visa status and been permanently unable to return to the US\n\nwas literally playing with my entire future\n\namidst all this chaos, i did end up making one or two really good friends however\n\nthe only solace i'd get once in a while was going to the Dubai Mall for hotpot, just having normal fun conversations\n\none of them actually worked for the CIA - he'd have the coolest & most surreal stories, we would often hit the gym together\n\nand finally, the turning point came in November 2024 at 2 AM\n\nwhen i discovered a video about AI chatbots\nwith nothing to lose, i built my first chatbot that night\nstarted selling basic AI services on Upwork\nbegan making real money from AI systems\nand kept doubling down on it\n\naround the start of this year, i returned to the US when AI work generated consistent income\n\nand since then, its been only up\n\nso yeah\n\nthere was a fair amount of loneliness during that stint\n\ncomplete uncertainty on a day by day basis. in flight or fight mode pretty much 24/7\n\nconstantly thinking where i'm going to get my next 10 AED from \n\nbut exposing myself to all of that turmoil has definitely given me an edge in business, whether it comes to negotiation, deal-making, seeing through shit, leading people, putting people in their place, etc\n\nif you're also chasing any kind of goal/ mission \n\njust remember that its never truly over\n\nit only is when you convince yourself it is \n\nyou can always rise from the ashes \n\nand have an epic comeback story to tell",
