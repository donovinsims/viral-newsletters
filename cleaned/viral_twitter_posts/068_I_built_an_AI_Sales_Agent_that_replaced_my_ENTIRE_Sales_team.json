  "text": "I built an AI Sales Agent that replaced my ENTIRE Sales team.\n\nwhile I was asleep (and slightly hungover), it followed up with 86 leads and closed 4 deals.\n\n$32,000 recovered from the graveyard of ghosted Gmail threads.\n\nhere’s what my n8n automation does:\n\n– reads your past emails, call transcripts and CRM notes\n– writes pain-based follow-ups in your voice\n– sends 5-touch sequences per lead\n– detects replies + stops the sequence instantly\n– logs every message into one living sales thread\n\nno more missed timing. no more “just checking in.”\n\nit’s like giving every cold lead the attention of your best SDR on their best day — forever.\n\nthe workflow includes: \n\n- Lead intelligence engine\n- Behavioural profiling engine\n- Self-writing sequences\n- Autonomous reply handling \n- Multi-angle personlization\n\nif you’re tired of chasing ghosts… this one's for you. \n\nthis isn't just \"automation\". \n\nit's your AUTONOMOUS REVENUE engine. \n\nand you're getting it for free\n\nComment \"SDR\" + repost this + follow me\nI'll DM you everything in the next hour\n\nthis isn't some half-built demo\n\nthis is a production-ready SaaS you can launch this weekend",
