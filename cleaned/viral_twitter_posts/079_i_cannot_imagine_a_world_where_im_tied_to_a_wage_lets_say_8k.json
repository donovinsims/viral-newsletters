  "text": "i cannot imagine a world where i'm tied to a wage, lets say $8k/month at an office job...\n\nand there being no way of increasing that other than licking your bosses ass to get a promotion\n\nwhen the average guy is complaining about a lack of money & you tell him to \"just make more\" - he'll look at you like he just saw an alien\n\nbut that's exactly what he should do - just make more lol\n\nthe idea of making more than the salary you're tied down by is extremely foreign to someone not in our world",
