  "text": "high performers prefer text-based information sources bc they subconsciously understand that it's easier to store & structure info in text format than video/audio...\n\nit's rare for video-format informational content to be completely orderly & to not contain fluff - that doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but it's generally the truth\n\nwriting gives more time to reason, organize & revise ideas - hence why a book is more structured than a youtube video, & that video (based off a WRITTEN script) is more structured than an organic podcast",
