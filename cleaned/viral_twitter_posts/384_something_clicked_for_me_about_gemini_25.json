  "text": "something clicked for me about gemini 2.5...\n\nit's not the best at anything specific, right? but it's really good at almost everything\n\nthink about it:\n- GPT-5 crushes on reasoning tasks, then completely fumbles basic copywriting (like... unusably bad)\n- Claude? best writing quality I've seen, but no image gen and no video\n- Gemini 2.5 is just... consistently solid across the board\n\nand the truth is that most people don't need \"the best\" model for one task, they need ONE model that handles everything at like 80-90% quality\n\n(and honestly, 80% is good enough for 95% of what we're doing)\n\nif gemini 3.0 nails:\n- image generation (already good with nano banana)\n- video creation (already at the top with veo 3.1)\n- long-form writing\n- software development\n\nit becomes your only daily driver (at least for me)\n\nwe're not looking for specialists anymore... we're looking for the swiss army knife that actually works\n\nand gemini might win by being \"very good\" at everything instead of \"the best\" at one thing\n\nlooking forward to it",
