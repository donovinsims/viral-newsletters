  "text": "when people think about saas - they think their software needs to help people make money...\n\nbut there are extremely passionate communities out there with shared desires that are completely disconnected from making money...\n\nfor example, lets look at a software like billiongraves...\n\nit lets users index graves & thus acts a database of graves all around the world\n\nthis is a very simple, but valuable tool for anyone that performs geneological research\n\nthey monetize via. premium tiers which can access more records, can access pictures of graves, etc.\n\nsuch a simple saas now has 10-50 employees & pulls in roughly $5m-$20m - but people on X are convinced you need to be solving revolutionary problems to see a milly\n\nfind literally any passionate community & create software that solves their problems, then distribute it the right way & you'll be swimming in cash",
