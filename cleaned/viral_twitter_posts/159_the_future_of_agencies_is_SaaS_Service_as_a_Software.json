  "text": "the future of agencies is SaaS (Service as a Software)...\n\nturns out the best way to scale is to deliver your core service through software - cuts communication by 80%, makes delivery stupid simple, and somehow clients value it MORE\n\nhere's how to set this up using Whop right now:\n- configure a proper onboarding sequence\n- put all client resources in one whop (no more \"where's that link?\" emails)\n- your software integrated as a whop app (feels premium, works seamlessly)\n- premium custom services as upsells\n- payments, communication, delivery - all in one platform\n\nthe goal is to have the whole thing feel like a product instead of a service",
