  "text": "This Claude MCP AI agent writes better posts than your $5,000 ghostwriter\n\nwhile I was doom-scrolling TikTok at 4am, it analyzed my entire content history, found 12 psychological triggers, and built me a content blueprint that actually converts.\n\nWhat agencies charge $15K for (content audits + strategy)...\nNow takes 30 seconds. Complete analysis.\n\nhere's what the system does:\n\n– uploads your content history → instant psychological breakdown\n– identifies your top 3% performing hooks that drive real engagement\n– maps buyer psychology triggers that convert lurkers into pipeline\n– reveals hidden patterns human strategists miss completely\n– generates content engineered from your proven winners\n\nno more throwing hooks at the wall hoping something sticks.\n\nit's like having Deadpool write your copy - maximum chaos, maximum results, except it actually knows YOUR audience and what makes them click.\n\nthe workflow includes:\n\n- Content DNA analysis engine\n- Hook performance intelligence system\n- Buyer psychology mapper\n- Revenue-focused content generator\n- Complete blueprint documentation\n\nthis isn't another AI wrapper with fancy marketing.\n\nit's surgical content intelligence deployed at machine speed.\n\nComment \"MCP\" + repost this + follow me\nI'll DM you the complete Claude setup in the next hour\n\nskip this, and keep guessing why your \"valuable\" posts get 4 likes.",
