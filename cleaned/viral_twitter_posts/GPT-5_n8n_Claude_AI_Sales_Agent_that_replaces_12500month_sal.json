  "text": "GPT-5 + n8n + Claude = AI Sales Agent that replaces $12,500+/month sales teams...\n\n(the exact system we deployed for 8-figure companies)\n\nMost sales teams have pre-call problems:\n→ Leads book then go cold\n→ 67% show up skeptical or unprepared\n→ Half the call wasted on basic education\n\nThis system fixes that.\n\nUpload your CRM → detects new bookings → sends value-driven sequences that warm leads before calls.\n\nHere's how it works:\n→ Booking Intelligence Engine (instant activation on new meetings)\n→ Authority Content Delivery (strategic case studies, frameworks, proof)\n→ Precision Timing System (perfect 2-day, 1-day, 15-min intervals)\n→ Pre-Call Warming Sequences (builds trust BEFORE the meeting)\n→ Engagement Intelligence (knows who's ready to buy)\n→ Pipeline Velocity Engine (accelerates deal closure by 2x)\n→ Automatic CRM Synchronization (sales intel updates itself)\n\nDeployed for 8-figure companies.\nZero manual intervention required.\nComplete pipeline transformation.\n\nResults after 30 days:\n- 30% fewer no-shows\n- 24% more replies before calls\n- 2x faster sales velocity\n- Calls start with \"let's talk next steps\" not \"what do you do?\"\n\nWant the complete system blueprint?\n\nLike + comment \"VELOCITY\" + repost, and I'll DM it to you.\n(must be following)",
