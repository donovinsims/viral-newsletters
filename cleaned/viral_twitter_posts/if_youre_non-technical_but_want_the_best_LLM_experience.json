  "text": "if you're non-technical but want the best LLM experience...\n\njust use claude\n\nhere's why:\n\nif you're technical -> you can go model agnostic\n- play with APIs\n- setup custom environments\n- plug any model into your workflows\n\nbut if you just want to open a website and get great outputs... claude is the only real option right now\n\nbecause it has everything built into the webapp:\n- writing styles\n- custom skills\n- MCP connections\n- projects for context\n- artifacts\n- code\n\nno technical setup required... it's all easy to use and actually works\n\ncompare this to the competition:\n\ngemini has a basic chat interface with limited customization\nchatgpt has some features but nothing close to claude's depth\n\nyou CAN replicate a claude setup with third party apps but if you're a beginner who just wants it to work out of the box...\n\nget claude -> follow their guides -> start creating & get the best outputs\n\nthat's it",
