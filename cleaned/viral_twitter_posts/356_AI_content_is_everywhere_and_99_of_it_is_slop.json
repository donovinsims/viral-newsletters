  "text": "AI content is everywhere and 99% of it is slop...\n\nmeanwhile it takes 2 hours to build a system that creates content 10x better than most humans\n\nhere's the difference between AI slop and undetectable AI content:\n- strong prompt engineering\n- specific brand voice development\n- feeding tons of good copywriting examples to AI\n\nif you think you can spot AI content, you're wrong bro\n\nthere are accounts with 200k+ followers running 100% AI tweets on autopilot, major blogs completely automated, newsletters with 20k+ subs fully AI written\n\nbut most people won't do the work to build proper systems... they want instant results with zero effort",
