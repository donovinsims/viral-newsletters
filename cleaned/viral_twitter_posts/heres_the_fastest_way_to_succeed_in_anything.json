  "text": "here's the fastest way to succeed in anything:\n\nget people who've made it to roast your work\n\nsounds backwards, i know... but it works surprisingly well\n\nwhen i started my first agency, i did what everyone does: asked for \"feedback\" (which is code for \"tell me it's great\")\n\ngot nowhere, everyone was too nice, zero growth\n\nthen i flipped the script... paid $500 for 30 mins with a guy doing $100k/month, sent him my entire process and said \"rip this apart, don't hold back\"\n\nhe tore it to shreds in 12 minutes... but those 12 minutes saved me 2 years of trial and error\n\nthink about it:\n> he saw the bottleneck i was blind to (because i was IN it)\n> he fixed my positioning with one sentence that changed everything\n> he told me exactly what to cut and where to double down\n\nfelt like cheating tbh... still does\n\nnow i do this for every business i run, find the person who's already where i want to be, pay them to be brutal with me, and suddenly i'm moving 10x faster than everyone else who's \"figuring it out themselves\"\n\nthe ROI on that $500 is probably 500x by now... and it keeps compounding\n\ninvest in roast, it's 100% worth",
