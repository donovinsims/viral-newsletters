  "text": "pre 2015 family gatherings of 30+ people were a super frequent thing...\n\nnowadays you'd be lucky to get 10 people at a dinner table on christmas eve, it's really sad\n\ni spoke to a couple friends and they all had the same experience\n\nwhenever i look at old pics of my family from 1900-1960 it shocks me how many family members got together for certain occassions, looked like happier times\n\ni don't know what exactly happened - whether it's phones, social media, lack of religion etc. but families have gotten significantly more distant\n\nhave you had the same experience?",
