  "text": "i've known a few guys with $10M+ net worth... and they all share ONE thing:\n\nthey're all deep into the \"woo-woo\" stuff... all the mindset work\n\nand when you ask them directly, they'll tell you this accounts for at least 50% of their success\n\npersonally, i'm not that invested in it\n\ni studied the core concepts... natural law, compound effect, discipline fundamentals... but nothing beyond that\n\nthese guys are the absolute stereotype: meditation every morning, affirmations, daily journaling...\n\nand it works incredibly well for them... they literally can't function without these practices anymore\n\nmaybe there's something there we're all missing",
