  "text": "after testing like 30 different AI writing setups, i keep coming back to this: Kimi K2 in Typingmind\n\nprojects for organization, knowledge bases for memory, custom agents for personality... everything just clicks\n\nthe output quality is consistently better than anything else i've used - which surprised me, tbh\n\ni thought i'd need multiple models for different tasks, but this one setup handles 90% of my writing\n\nand yeah, when Gemini 3.0 drops i'll test that too, but i have a feeling Kimi K2 is gonna be the one to beat\n\nit's that good already",
