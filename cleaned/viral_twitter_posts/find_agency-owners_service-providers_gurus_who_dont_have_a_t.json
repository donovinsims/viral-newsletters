  "text": "find agency-owners / service-providers / gurus who don't have a twitter presence yet... (find them on platforms like YT, IG & TT)\n\nthen find big accounts on twitter that are in their niche\n\nreach out to those twitter accounts & ask them if they'd help boost the posts of the influencers you want to bring to twitter for a % of profits that come from that account - it's a no brainer\n\nonce you've got someone who has agreed, start reaching out to these influencers...\n\ntell them that you'll run their twitter presence for them for a % of all profits that come from the X account\n\nonce you've got a few, use AI to extract the top insights/ideas from their existing content & format it in an engaging tweet format & get the big account to engage with it to boost it to their audience\n\nonce that account has enough motion, you can start shilling the influencers offer\n\non top of that, you can set up a whop community for them for additional revenue",
