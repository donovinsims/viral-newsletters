  "text": "15 months ago I was figuring out AI Automations selling chatbots for $180.\n\nNow I'm doing $80K/month selling to BCG, BMW & Fortune 500 companies.\n\n(full system breakdown: Upwork → enterprise positioning → 50-person dev team)\n\nMost people selling AI are stuck making these mistakes:\n→ Cold DMing executives with zero buyer intent\n→ Positioning as \"automation expert\" like every freelancer\n→ Building alone and hitting $10K/month ceiling\n→ Showing generic demos when enterprise wants custom systems\n\nMeanwhile enterprise AI budgets sit untapped.\n\nJust watch how I went from $180 projects to $20K+ retainers systematically.\n\nPerfect for AI builders stuck under $20K/month who want enterprise clients.\n\nHere's what's inside:\n→ Upwork strategy that landed first client in 24 hours (high buyer intent vs cold DMs)\n→ Live B2B system walkthrough (hyper-personalized copy from LinkedIn intel)\n→ Internal referral loop (scaled past $20K/month, zero outbound)\n→ Positioning shift that unlocked $20K+ monthly retainers\n→ Shipping systems in 6 days vs 6-month agency timelines\n→ Building 50-person specialist team (specialists only, async execution, zero bloat)\n\nSame infrastructure deployed for BMW, BCG & Fortune 500 operations.\n\n31 minutes. Real deployments. Zero fluff.\n\nRT + follow & comment \"LUMA\" to get access in DMs.",
