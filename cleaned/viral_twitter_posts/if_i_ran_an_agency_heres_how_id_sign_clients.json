  "text": "if i ran an agency here's how i'd sign clients...\n\n> demonstrate expertise & build authority by teaching\n> use the motion to advertise my services\n\ni'd start an X account & my tweets would be tailored to other people trying to learn how to do what i do\n\nthis builds an audience, which builds authority & signals that you're the go-to guy for said service\n\nyou probably wouldn't even need to advertise your service at all tbh, people will just naturally reach out to you...\n\nit's pretty simple as long as you're good at what you do",
