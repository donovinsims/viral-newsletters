  "text": "i have an issue with people jumping directly from working a 9-5 to building their own stuff online...\n\ni credit a lot of my success to working for a successful agency, seeing the backend/how they operate & learning from it\n\nthis helped me replicate & start my own agency which made me learn even more\n\nonly then, after creating a ton of value for others, i figured that maybe i should package my solution in diff formats (software, info, etc.)\n\nlots of people try to skip that period in the trenches & therefore have no idea which problems to solve, how to solve them & how to even package their solution in an attractive way\n\nbecoming a master is hard w/o first becoming an apprentice",
