It's time to get even.\n\nShare\n\nThere’s one story that makes me cry every time.\n\nA man in his 70s spends 14 years writing a fiction book. It took him so long because he worked full-time and prioritized his family.\n\nHe finally self-publishes his book on Amazon, but no one buys it. His daughter spies on him while he works away, and she records it with her phone. She then uploads the video to TikTok.\n\n> “I’d love for him to get some book sales.”\n\n“I’d love for him to get some book sales.”\n\nThe video gets watched 33M times. It goes mega-viral. People check out the book and realize it’s an absolute freaking banger. Now her father is a best-selling author.\n\nI love this story because it shows the power of working on your dream after hours. Anything is possible. Even if the dream takes a little longer than expected, it’s one of the best feelings in the world to build something you own and defy the critics.\n\nI followed a similar path. I wrote online every day before and after my banking job. No one knew for a long time. And when people did find out, they loved to give me useless advice and tell me it was a pipe dream. I sure proved those fools wrong.\n\nA side hustle is an act of rebellion.\n\nIt’s as beautiful and miraculous as my 2 year old daughter who makes everything in life pure joy. When I started my side hustle I had nothing. I worked a minimum wage job and barely had $100 left after paying bills.\n\nEntrepreneur Jesse Itzler started in a similar fashion. He lived in a NYC apartment that was 18 feet long and 10 feet wide. It cost him $375 a month for the privilege. It wasn’t really an apartment though. It was a crawl space. The ceiling was 4 feet high.\n\nHe says “When you START WITH NOTHING. You STOP FOR NOTHING.”\n\nMost of us start something on the side and get discouraged by the fact we have nothing. But it’s actually the best motivation there is because you have nothing to lose. You can take risks and it doesn’t matter.\n\n# 9-5 jobs cop an unnecessary beating by gurus\n\nYour 9-5 job isn’t the enemy despite what some gurus preach from the high tower.\n\nA job is a necessary evil. The title of this essay comes from an Alex Hormozi tweet. He agrees that jobs don’t kill our dreams. We’re pointing the shotgun at the wrong culprit.\n\n> 9-5 you work to feed your present.5-9 you work to feed your future– Hormozi\n\n9-5 you work to feed your present.5-9 you work to feed your future– Hormozi\n\nWhen you look at jobs in this new light they’re gorgeous little angels in white. They serve a purpose. A job is a great place to get started, but they’re a terrible place to end. They’ll only get you so far in life.\n\nWhat you build after hours is what makes you high agency (resourceful).\n\nIn a job, you’re spoon-fed like a baby. If any little mess happens in your life, you just ask for some time off and it’s granted.\n\nBut in the real world of work driven by agency and entrepreneurship, you have to burn the diapers and stand still on your own feet.\n\nThe goal is to reach this point as fast as possible, especially in an age of AI where those without agency will be burned at the stake while the robots smile.\n\n# Complaining does nothing. Get even.\n\n9-5 jobs can be painful.\n\nLong hours, underpaid, layoffs, bad bosses, toxic cultures, wokeism, nanny police, pretending-to-do-good-while-doing-evil-corporates, etc.\n\nI can’t fix these problems or cure world hunger. I’m just an average IQ Aussie with a Tesla, and a 2 year old daughter who has a terrible potty mouth like her father.\n\nWe can complain and blame and hope the factory worker model of work changes. But the better solution I’ve found is to just get even.\n\nTake the unfair world of 9-5 jobs and channel that energy into a side hustle. Then succeed at it and quietly quit your job with a smile (eventually). That’s a more compelling future than hoping the rules of work change which may take 50 years.\n\n# The big problem no one wants to talk about\n\nI’m gonna piss some people off right now. Ready?\n\n9-5 jobs aren’t the main problem. It’s the fact you waste the hours of 5 PM until 9 PM doing dumb sh*t that serves no purpose. I call it the distraction economy. Mindless reality TV shows and Netflix back-to-back seasons about nothing.\n\nDan Koe says “The 2 hours you spend scrolling each day on your phone (or 730 hours each year) could have produced a book, a business, or a body you don't currently have.”\n\nHe’s not wrong.\n\nThe time to build your dreams does exist. Read that again.\n\nThere are 104 days a year that you get off, also known as weekends. Plus you get before and after work. A life of wealth and freedom requires some small sacrifices. I found working on my side hustle didn’t feel like a sacrifice because it was driven by pure obsession fuelled by flow states.\n\nI was a pig rolling in sh*t & loving the taste of it (with poo on the brain every damn day).\n\nSo the barrier to your hopes and dreams is simplistic: will you find the time? That time slot, in case you’re wondering, is 5 PM - 9 PM. If you won’t work on your dream at that time, then you’ll probably take it to the grave or start when you’re 95 and out of energy.\n\n“But that’s hustle culture Timothy!”\n\nNo it’s not. When you’re working on something you love it’s not work. You can use fancy labels like hustle culture to let yourself off the hook, but you’re only screwing yourself up the butt without a cond0m. Don’t do it, it’s a trap.\n\nNone of us started our side hustle with zero responsibilities and a blank calendar. That’s a naughty p*rn fantasy you may have been indulging in. None of us started by working 16 hours a day either. We all eased ourselves into it through the 5-9 rule.\n\n5-9 is the obvious answer you’ve been looking for.\n\nUse this formula from Dan Koe to get started building momentum:\n\n> 1 hour of focused work on the weekdays.4+ hours of focused work on the weekends.\n\n1 hour of focused work on the weekdays.4+ hours of focused work on the weekends.\n\n# Dead grandpas were preaching this stuff decades ago\n\nThis 5-9 idea may sound new. It’s not.\n\nEarl Nightingale was a grandpa who was worshipped by the self-help world. He said this back in the old days when we drove around in horse and cart:\n\nBottom line: 1 hour a day of work in your chosen field is all it takes to be successful.\n\nDon’t overcomplicate it. Don’t misunderstand me. Don’t go email 50 gurus to ask them their secrets for success. This is it. The answer has been staring you in the face like the way Michaelangelo’s David statue in Italy does when you get up close to it and see his rock-hard p3nis made of marble for the first time.\n\nSay it again with me:\n\n“1 hour a day is all it takes to build a life most people can only dream of.”\n\nLouder! Louder! Say yes! (Okay, I’ll stop with the Tony Robbins chant.)\n\n# The last piece of the 5-9 puzzle is perhaps the most powerful\n\nWhen you start to work 5-9 on an after hours side hustle people are gonna think you’ve gone bat sh*t crazy. They’ll call you weird or different. They’ll misunderstand you. They may even try to talk you out of it.\n\nDon’t let them. Keep in mind what author Robert Greene said:\n\n> Always stick to what makes you weird, odd, strange, different. That’s your source of power.\n\nAlways stick to what makes you weird, odd, strange, different. That’s your source of power.\n\nBeing weird is the differentiator. Not being like everyone else is how you join the top 1% in any field. It’s a great compass for “Am I doing the right thing?”\n\nAre people calling you weird? Do you feel like an outcast? Does it feel like you’re working two jobs? Is it uncomfortable?\n\nGOOD!\n\nI don’t ever want to be like anyone else because that’ll turn me into a sheep that goes baa baa baa and watches news and politics and cares too much about what Elon or any other political figure is up to.\n\nInstead of being obsessed with the mainstream narrative, become obsessed with something that makes you hide in a dark bedroom for hours on end with the door closed. That’ll get you further ahead and give your life meaning.\n\n9-5 jobs aren’t the enemy. The enemy is the distraction economy that lights your 5-9 time slot on fire so you have no time to do anything extraordinary. Fight the resistance. Protect the hours of 5-9 PM like your life depends on it – because it does.\n\nYour future is created while working a 9-5 job and building your dreams between 5-9.\n\n---\n\nP.S. Only 7 hours left to join my workshop: Make 3X As Much Money Online Without Changing Anything About Your Offer\n\nIf you're a one-person business on the 5-9 grind, this is a must-see.\n\nGrab your seat here before the deadline"
