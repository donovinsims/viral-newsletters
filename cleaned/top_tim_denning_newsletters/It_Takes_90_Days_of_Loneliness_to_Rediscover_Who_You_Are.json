Some say that makes me a loser.\n\nI’ve always been that way and thought it was a bad thing. In my 20s everyone wanted to go out and party. I just wanted to sit in my bedroom and make electronic music. When I tried to take that music out to nightclubs as a DJ, I crashed and burned.\n\nI now see loneliness differently, and you will too (shortly).\n\n# The discomfort of isolation\n\nLoneliness is uncomfortable.\n\nWhen I worked in banking I had to say no a lot. No to after-work drinks. No to weekends away with other bankers. No to going to the AFL football (our bank was the major sponsor).\n\nEach no made me feel like crap. Like I was letting people down or something was wrong with me. But if I didn’t, then I would never have had the headspace to be a writer.\n\nModern life is slowly making us go insane.\n\nWe can’t switch off. We can’t escape. We live in constant FOMO. We have headphones on 24/7 that destroy our hearing and leave us with a high-pitched ringing in our ears, that contributes to the insanity. It’s why modern life is a horror film.\n\nWhen you always have other people’s voices playing in your headphones, you drown out your own voice. You forget who you are. You can’t hear yourself think. Therefore, you can’t be creative or solve big problems.\n\nSo what are you left with? Crippling boredom that requires endless entertainment to numb the pain.\n\nLoneliness starts out as uncomfortable because most of us don’t do it. Even when we are alone we have Netflix or our phone to talk with us. We’re truly never alone.\n\nTo unlock your inner genius you must embrace isolation for a long enough time.\n\n“He moves fastest who moves alone.” ― Milton Friedman\n\n# Lean into your dark side\n\nAll of us have a dark side.\n\nWe unlock it when we’re alone. A recent example is Ben Affleck. He married Jennifer Lopez who he thought was the love of his life after decades of wanting one another.\n\nWithin two years they’re getting a divorce. This love affair started almost 20 years ago. Sources close to Ben say he has a dark side. He can never be fully present because he needs extended periods of solitude.\n\nBut his ex-wife JLO didn’t understand it. She wanted him to always be present. To always want to go away or be in the spotlight. On their honeymoon Ben and JLO had paparazzi around them all the time.\n\nIt led Ben to madness. So their marriage ended.\n\nI can relate to this. Thankfully my wife knows I need solitude. She also likes the same alone time, so it works well for us.\n\nIn my banking days, I remember working out of a bank branch. All the other bankers would go home at 5 PM. I’d stay back. I’d finish my banking work at 5 PM and stick around to record podcasts with successful people. Or I’d stay there and write.\n\nMost nights I wouldn’t leave before 9 or 10 PM. I stayed so late one night that I slept in my car. I was obsessed with this new life I’d found. I wanted to exit banking as quickly as possible, but knew only loneliness would get me there.\n\nThe other bankers used to make fun of me. They said I lived at the office. Bosses thought it was awesome. But no one knew I lived at the office to build my own thing, not do useless banking work like open bank accounts for customers.\n\nYour dark side is where hidden potential is found. It comes out to play after hours.\n\n> “Being alone is a power very few can handle” – Aaron Will\n\n“Being alone is a power very few can handle” – Aaron Will\n\n# Success isn’t complicated (but everyone thinks it is)\n\nWhen I see complicated paths to success, I see bullsh*t.\n\nLoneliness is a powerful tool to get anything you want in life. If you do it for 90 days everything will change in your life. Here’s the thing: I can’t promise you what will change because it’s different for everyone.\n\nWhat I know is loneliness forces you to rediscover who you are.\n\nYou won’t come out the other side of 90 days of deep solitude the same person. It’s exciting. It’s breathtaking. But it takes a level of discomfort most can’t handle.\n\nThe first few days are like being 48 hours into a water fast. This memory stands out as I’m 8 weeks away from another stint in hospital. Before I go under the knife, I’ll have to fast beforehand so it’s safe for the anesthetic.\n\nAs the hunger sets in so too will the darkness.\n\nI’ve been down this road since 2015. First, I’ll wonder whether the cancer comes back. Then I’ll stress about the hospital because I hate needles and blood. This time I’ll stress harder because I have a 1 year old daughter. What if the hospital goes wrong?\n\nBut as wild as it sounds, I look forward to this darkness.\n\nIt’s deeply motivating. It interrupts my thought patterns and I come out the other side 10x more grateful than the average person who takes everything for granted.\n\nThe fasting will require solitude. The recovery in the hospital will require solitude, too. I wonder what the loneliness will teach me this time?\n\n“Time alone isn’t lonely, it’s freedom” – OrangeBook\n\n# 90 days is all it takes to rediscover who you are\n\nMy challenge to you is to embrace 90 days of loneliness.\n\nHere’s what to do in the 90 days:\n\n* Delete all your goals. Start again.\n* Start writing daily online so you can use it to think deeply.\n* Create a new vision for your life. Dream big. Remove the limiting valves on your consciousness.\n* Think of one way to build a new network of people from scratch.\n* Read more autobiographies than you ever read before – Steve Jobs, Winston Churchill, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Andre Agassi, and Alexander Hamilton.\n* Take some new risks.\n\nDelete all your goals. Start again.\n\nStart writing daily online so you can use it to think deeply.\n\nCreate a new vision for your life. Dream big.

Turn off social media. Quit all the networking events. Stop trying to be a socialite with your neighbors, The Joneses (who don’t give a f*ck about you), and just work on yourself.\n\n90 days.3 months.A quarter of a year.\n\nIt’s no time at all, yet it’s a decent chunk of your life. I promise you, if you do this, your life will never be the same again. Most won’t. But the few of you who do are why I’ve written this.\n\nTell me if this big idea resonates with you and why in the comments.\n\n---\n\nI send this email weekly.
