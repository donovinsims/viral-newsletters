Choose a life so far away from a typical career that no one understands what the hell you do for a living.\n\nThe most successful people I’ve ever met live this way. They’re unexplainable. They can’t be summarised in a 30-second elevator pitch. There’s nuance to their story. They have scars. They don’t openly share everything.\n\n# The price of freedom is being misunderstood\n\nNo one knows what I do for a living.\n\nMy neighbours think I’m a drug dealer. They say I use my two Teslas to transport coke. They think this way because I’m always home. In the middle of the day they’ll see me on the porch drinking orange juice. Or playing in the backyard with my kiddo.\n\n“Who the heck has a tea party with a 2 year old at 10:26 AM on a Monday?” they say.\n\nFormer colleagues have speculated that I have a hidden trust fund. That I’m secretly the son of an African prince and have millions deposited into my bank account every month. Nice theory. Would be cool.\n\nOthers in my neighbourhood have a much smaller imagination. They just think I’m flat-out unemployed. That I’ve been unemployable for 5 years. That my wife must be the breadwinner and have a high-paying job. My wife is actually the unemployed one right now.\n\nShe got fired for being 7 months pregnant.\n\nSo much for 9-5 job security.\n\nI don’t make things easier for people. When they ask what I do for a living I either change the subject or tell them I work in finance. That’s technically lying. I shouldn’t do it. I know it’s bad.\n\nI just can’t be f*cked with the judgment anymore.\n\nWhen I was actually a banker in my former life, people understood it. They know what a banker does. They likely know the bank I worked for. They can easily put me in a box. They can correctly label me. They can google me and see my resume on LinkedIn.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nHow the f*ck would I ever explain to a normal person what I do for a living now? Writer? No. Influencer? No. Online business? No. Affiliate marketer? No. Workshop guy? Online education? Youtuber?\n\nWhat I now do for work is unexplainable. Even potential clients can get confused. “Do you have a website that explains your business, what you sell, how much, etc?”\n\nThey’re devastated when I tell them there’s no website. It’s invite-only. I keep quiet. I don’t advertise much.\n\nEven people I do work with get confused. At a surface level I come across as some sort of internet marketer, business consultant, or even coach. And on some days I’m some of those things. But I got thinking about this recently and had a revelation.\n\nOn the surface, I help people start or grow a digital business. But I’m not a shallow guy. If I get a little more philosophical, what I end up realizing I do is help people figure out what they want to do with their life. And I help them feed their family with new income streams.\n\nWhen I think about what I do in this way, I get emotional.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the stakes are extremely high. If I fail to help someone figure out what they want to do with their life, it may not end well. They may even take their life. And if I fail at helping them with monetisation, then their kids may starve.\n\nTrying to explain that in a f*cking 30-second elevator pitch to the average person who just wants to put you in a box and slap a label on you so they can understand… is exhausting.\n\nThe moment you stop fitting into society’s boxes, they’ll call you crazy, lucky, or a liar.\n\n# The best way to make a living is to be deeply philosophical\n\nToo many people don’t comprehend the bigger picture.\n\nThey choose a career or a way to earn a living and don’t understand what they really do. When this happens you don’t deeply connect to your why. So you don’t have the motivation, energy, and drive to succeed in any field.\n\nEvery pursuit in life can be broken apart and tied to a bigger goal or impact. When you do that it reframes the meaning of your life and will likely inspire you to:\n\n* Be better\n* Be relentless\n* Be obsessed\n* Stop lollygagging through life and take action\n\nBe better\n\nBe relentless\n\nBe obsessed\n\nStop lollygagging through life and take action\n\nA philosophical approach to work and making a living gives us purpose.

He’s an aerospace engineer at JPL who worked on the Mars missions (the planet, not the chocolate bar).

The job description reads: it’s complicated.\n\nIf you had to document some of what he does, you might write:\n\n* designing novel landing systems for Mars\n* dynamic systems engineering\n* bridging physics\n* robotics\n* software\n* mission risk\n\ndesigning novel landing systems for Mars\n\ndynamic systems engineering\n\nbridging physics\n\nrobotics\n\nsoftware\n\nmission risk\n\nYou could add the word AI, too, if you wanted more buzzwords for LinkedIn.\n\nUnless you worked in aerospace or engineering, most of what he says would go over your head.
