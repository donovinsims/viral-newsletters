I was going nowhere and seeing the world through a very dark lens. This phase of life had been forgotten, though.\n\nLast week a reader asked me to be on his podcast. I said no because podcasts are not my thing. Instead, I opted to answer a few questions for him. One of those questions was about that dark moment back in 2011.\n\nWriting my answers to his questions brought up all sorts of strange feelings and memories I thought were lost forever. In my answers, he wanted me to dig a little deeper.\n\nAnd when I did, this list of things I had to give up to survive and make it through to today became abundantly clear. They might help you if you feel like you’re falling behind, going nowhere, or like you’ve had enough.\n\n# Give up the story\n\nFeeling stuck or having enough is a story you tell yourself.\n\nThe doctor can’t diagnose you with “feeling stuck.” That same doctor can’t take your temperature and send you off for tests and then come back and say “Well, the blood test says you’ve had enough, Jane.”\n\nAll of this is one giant story. You narrate your life through what you say to yourself in your head. Your thoughts are yours.\n\nI’ve never shared this before so here goes nothing. The story I used to tell myself went like this:\n\n> I am tired. I am sick.I can’t play any sport which means I am weak.I have an eating disorder.Everybody hates me.I am skinny which means I am ugly.\n\n* I am tired. I am sick.\n* I can’t play any sport which means I am weak.\n* I have an eating disorder.\n* Everybody hates me.\n* I am skinny which means I am ugly.\n\nI am tired. I am sick.\n\nI can’t play any sport which means I am weak.\n\nI have an eating disorder.\n\nEverybody hates me.\n\nI am skinny which means I am ugly.\n\nElements of this story would repeat in my head daily. I couldn’t hear myself telling this story but I was definitely a part of it.\n\nUntil I became the outsider who dared to look in, the story was invisible to me.\n\nHow do you give up your limiting story? You write down your thoughts. When you can see your thoughts on paper they look different. They show you who you really are, not who you think you are.\n\nOnce you see your story and the lies you’re telling yourself, you have the option to change it. You may not change but at least you will have the chance.\n\n# Give up waiting for the right time\n\nThe right time is now.\n\nFeeling stuck or like you’ve had enough is an urgent problem that needs addressing. Remember this: there is never a right time to do anything.\n\nThe only right time is when you feel like you’ve had enough or you want to do something about this situation.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be like this forever. I lived with this feeling for the first 26 years of my life. It stopped me from doing so much and living a little of the good life. I wish I’d done something about it sooner.\n\nYou don’t have to go through the same torture day after day and call it a life.\n\nIt’s the right time to give up waiting for the perfect time.\n\n# Give up drinking\n\nAlcohol is sold to us subliminally through the phrases “work drinks” and “let’s go out on Saturday Night.”\n\nI was a heavy drinker for most of my life. I explained my drinking to myself as “fun.” It wasn’t fun at all. Waking up with a hangover and trying to pretend life didn’t happen solved nothing.\n\nThe alcohol was a band-aid for my battered brain.\n\nThe problems were still there the next day after an almighty hangover that stole all of the morning, and most of the afternoon.\n\nDrinking isn’t going to help you get to where you want to go. Drinking will cloud your judgment, destroy your energy levels, and harm your health long-term.\n\nReplace “the drink” for a habit that helps you be radically self-aware.\n\n# Give up on the majority of requests on your time\n\nI have been a yes man (thank you mam!) for most of my life.\n\nWhen people ask for my time, I feel guilty for saying no, so I say yes. For years this robbed me of the time to do anything creative.\n\nYou don’t need to say yes to everyone’s requests. You can say no and not be an a**hole about it. You don’t even need to provide a valid reason.\n\nIt’s okay to have time to live your life and to have the breathing space to think. As I write this I am experiencing extreme overwhelm. All requests of my time in the short-term have been canceled while I recover.\n\nIt’s hard to progress or get moving again when you’ve opted into drowning in other people’s requests. Saying no is often necessary and it’s okay.\n\n# Give up your career safety pants\n\n“Four weeks pay.” Remember that is all that separates you from being fired.\n\nThey care about you — until a recession changes their minds and they are blinded from seeing your value, by a spreadsheet titled “Job Cuts.”\n\nYou think you matter to your employer and you do, but that entitles you to nothing. Tough economic times outweigh a company’s like for you and the work you do.\n\nThere is no such thing as a safe career anymore. At some point it pays to think about de-risking your career and dividing your time up between multiple sources of income.\n\nThey can cut you and it’s not personal. Last year’s performance review holds very little power. Take a few more risks in your career.\n\nThe biggest risk in your career is playing it too safe.\n\n# Give up on notifications\n\nPlaying ping pong with your brain is exhausting. You don’t need constant sounds, notifications, alerts and gorgeous red badges.\n\nWhat appears urgent according to your phone is not so urgent in real life. The email can wait but your life cannot.\n\n# Give up on the critics\n\nThey can pick apart anything, even an innocent salad sandwich.\n\nYou can’t win an argument with a critic. They have a Google link (which is fact) to back up everything they say.\n\nLet them have their opinion and learn what you can from it. But trying to argue with them is pointless. There has never been a statue erected for a critic, says composer Jean Sibelius.\n\nReplace the need to be “right” — in front of your critics — for time with your family.\n\n# Give up being unkind to yourself\n\nI have tortured myself in my head for years. The F-Bombs and sharp critiques are mind-blowing when I look back.\n\nTalking down to yourself doesn’t serve you.\n\nYou know if you’re stuck or feel like you’ve had enough. You’re not stupid and you can move forward. Don’t let the unkindness towards yourself be the blocker to your potential. I am not talking about positive self-talk, either.\n\nTry being more understanding and forgiving towards yourself.\n\nRemind yourself that mistakes happen and you’re doing the best you can.\n\n# Give up destroying your confidence\n\n> Confidence isn’t the absence of fear. It’s the belief that you’ll be okay despite your fear — Nick Wignall\n\nConfidence isn’t the absence of fear. It’s the belief that you’ll be okay despite your fear — Nick Wignall\n\nDiscovering that quote recently changed the game for me. I have ripped apart my own confidence for years and it’s because of fear.\n\nThe fear of losing a job when I was employed or messing up my online business haunts me. This quote is a reminder that even if the worst happens, it’s all going to be okay.\n\nEven confident people deal with a lot of fear.\n\nSee your fear for what it is and don’t let it stop you from being confident that you can succeed when you do your best.\n\n# Give up on your short-term results\n\n“I only had six people read my blog post. What do I do?”\n\nYou know we could guess for hours about why your 10th blog post ever didn’t reach a thousand or more people. The truth is we will never know.\n\n> Ten shots at anything is not enough. This is short-term thinking.\n\nTen shots at anything is not enough. This is short-term thinking.\n\nThe typical approach is to track your goals daily, weekly, or monthly. I have given up this approach for the most part. I track my goals in life yearly.\n\nWell, that’s a half-truth. I look at my goals more seriously in 5-year chunks.\n\n5 years is a good enough amount of time to evaluate your results. It’s enough steps to climb Mt Everest. It’s enough words on the page to write a novel or inspire a small group of people.\n\nOne week, one day, one month, doesn’t tell you a lot. You might be looking for results far too soon. And that is making you feel like you are stuck or have had enough of your current situation.\n\n# One thing *not* to give up\n\nWe’ve talked a lot about what to give up when you feel like you’ve had enough or feel stuck.\n\nThere is one thing to never give up on: yourself.\n\nMore specifically, the vision you have for your life. You can do and be anything you want when you don’t give up on yourself. Whatever it is that you think you might do with the time you have left in your life, it’s time to do it.\n\nIf you want to write a novel, then do it. If you want to be in the Olympics, then start training. If you want to do something more modest like start a family, then make those babies! If you want to work less, then start investing your time in skills that can pay you while you sleep.\n\nI nearly gave up on myself and succumbed to a life of mental torture. But I decided to make a different decision and back myself, and you can too.\n\nIf you feel stuck in life or like you’ve had enough, maybe it’s time to give up what doesn’t serve you or is limiting your potential.\n\n---\n\nI send this email weekly.
