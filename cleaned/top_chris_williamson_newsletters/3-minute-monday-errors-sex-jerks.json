An engineer showed executives a clunky prototype that could store photos on a cassette tape. They shelved the idea, afraid it would cannibalise their film business. For thirty years they sat on the future. Kodak filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Their great failure wasn’t a wrong bet, it was never placing the bet at all.\n\nDarwin had worked out natural selection by 1838 but kept the idea in a drawer for twenty years, too cautious to publish. It took another biologist, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently discovering the same thing to jolt him into action. Evolution itself nearly stayed hidden because of hesitation.\n\nWorld War I was even at the mercy of this. After the assassination in Sarajevo, Europe still had off-ramps. Austria could have paused before declaring war on Serbia. Germany could have told Austria to stand down. Britain could have made its red lines crystal clear. No one acted decisively and everyone waited for someone else. That hesitation turned a local killing into a world war.\n\n**TLDR: We remember the noise of bad choices. We rarely count the cost of silence.**\n\nCommission teaches lessons in days. Omission teaches lessons in decades, usually too late to apply them.\n\nI’m not saying you won’t regret the obvious agony of jobs you quit, loves you lost, or words you blurted out; I’m just saying you need to pay more attention to the unseen pain of the jobs you never left, the loves you never dared and the words you never spoke.\n\nWe wince at mistakes that make a noise, but it’s the silent mistakes that do the real damage.\n\nErrors of commission bruise the ego, errors of omission starve the soul."
