You are not your thoughts.**\nThe voice that speaks in your head is not you.\nYou are the one who hears it speak.\nDon’t identify with what your mind says any more than you identify with what someone on the street says.\nThis is one of the most liberating truths to know.\n\n**2. Action is the antidote to anxiety.**\nYou’re not afraid of the future when you’re moving yourself toward it.\nIf you feel anxiety creeping in, use it as a trigger to lean into action, not stagnation.\nDo something and you’ll feel better.\n\n**3. Loneliness is a kind of tax you have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind.**\nThe weirder you are, the fewer people are like you, the fewer people will “get” you.\nThis is fine.\n\n**4. Your weirdness is your competitive advantage.**\nNo one can beat you at being you.\nEmbrace your traumas, life experiences, scars, funny accent, whatever it is.\nThis is what sets you apart.\nThe weirder you are; the more unique you are; the more competitive & interesting you are.\n\n**5. Joy has to be found today, not tomorrow.**\nIf you can’t be happy with a coffee, you won’t be happy with a yacht.\nChoose to find joy in today, it’s there waiting for you.\n\n**6. Never lie.**\nWhether by omission or commission, lying degrades your virtue.\nYour internal sense of self worth is keeping check, even if you aren’t.\nTelling the truth is a superpower, it works for everything.\nStart being radically honest today and your life will change.\n\n**7. Keep promises to yourself.**\nYour faith in your own word is vital.\nBuild it up by starting with small promises.\nSay you’ll get up on time, say you’ll ring your parents.\nOver time you can promise yourself bigger and bigger things.\n\n**8. Most problems are easily fixed.**\n90% of issues can be solved by a good sleep, a glass of water, a gym session, a walk outdoors or a chat with a friend.\nOften you’ll find that low mood is accompanied by certain physical, habitual or environmental routines like staying in bed, being solitary, not eating or drinking well.\nThese are not a coping mechanism, they are a worsening mechanism.\nAvoid them at all costs.\n\n**9. You are the sky, everything else is just the weather.**\nYour anger, frustration, anxiety & everything else is just a visitor in your mind.\nSometimes it gets cloudy so you can’t see the sun, but it’s always there if you just breathe and let go of what is holding the clouds in place.\nTry and be angry for more than 5 minutes without constantly thinking about your anger, you can’t.\nRealise that you are the architect of your own mood."
