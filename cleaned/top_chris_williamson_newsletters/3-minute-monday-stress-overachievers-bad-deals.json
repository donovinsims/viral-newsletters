      "content": "Hi friend,\nHere are four of the most important things I’ve realised about problems and stress:\n**1. Problems are a feature of life, not a bug.**\nThere will never come a time when you have no problems.\nWhat, did you think that one day you’re just going to wake up and cease having problems?\nLike completing a video game and levelling up to a map where there’s nothing there?\nThat’s never going to happen.\nYour problems will change, but having problems is going nowhere.\nDealing with problems is the cost of doing business as a human, not a personal curse.\n**2. Whatever negativity is consuming your thoughts probably won’t matter in 3 months time.**\nIn 3 months, you won’t remember the corrosive texture of your mind.\nOr the boring, repetitive things you thought.\nOr maybe even what you were worried about.\nBut all that time you spent worrying will still have passed.\nSo you are sacrificing your joy and presence in the moment, for a problem which you won’t even be able to recall in the future.\nImmortality would be the only life in which such flippancy with the days you’re alive for is acceptable.\n**3. Learning comes from the edges.**\nChange is uncomfortable and it rarely happens without a lot of stress.\nMany of the periods of radical, important change in your life happened because of severe challenges that you faced.\nWould you pay the price back then for the insights and developments you have now?\nIf so, have faith that whatever stresses you’re facing will lead to a greater version of you in the future.\nThis challenge is a gift.\nLean into the discomfort as if you invited it through the door.\nSay thank you for the opportunity to learn and reflect, it’s making you better.\nAntifragility is alive and well every time we overcome these obstacles.\n**4. Stop taking things so seriously.**\nNo one is getting out of this game alive.\nLiterally.\nIn 3 generations, no one will even remember your name.\nIf that doesn’t give you liberation to just drop your problems and find some joy, I don’t know what will.\nLife is inherently ridiculous and guaranteed to end sooner or later.\nSo you might as well enjoy the ride."

How many nukes are in existence? What would happen if one was fired? Where gets hit first? What is the biggest bomb ever made?\nSaturday.Hamza Ahmed – harsh truths that men need to hear.
