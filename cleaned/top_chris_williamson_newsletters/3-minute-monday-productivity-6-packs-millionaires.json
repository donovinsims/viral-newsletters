I finally finished it.\n\nThis one took me so much time to put together, I really hope you like it.\n\nGoes live to the public this Wednesday 2nd July.\n\nYou guys will get access before anyone else though, just check your email inbox this Tuesday.\n\nAnyway, here’s 6 rules about productivity:\n\n**1. Your life does not need to be easier. It needs to be simpler.**\n\nYour system is designed to handle stress and challenge but not complication.\n\nYou probably handle hard things pretty well but feel overwhelmed when they become messy.\n\nDo not attribute to difficulty that which can be explained by complexity.\n\n**2. There is no such thing as being overworked, only under rested.**\n\nYou can deal with pretty much anything if you get a good night’s sleep, good food and sufficient movement.\n\nTaking your Rest Ethic more seriously as your Work Ethic is a hack to enjoy life more and get stuff done as a side effect.\n\n**3. You can have anything you want but not everything you want.**\n\nAll the gains accrue to the highest performers in any pursuit.\n\nFocus your efforts on escaping the messy middle where most competition is, then once you’ve burst out the top, put your foot on the gas even more.\n\nPassion projects on the side are often a distraction from what you should be focussed on doing: less, but better.\n\n**4. You can’t white knuckle creativity.**\n\nAll my best ideas come during workouts, meditation sessions (annoyingly), long walks, when listening to music and over dinner with friends.\n\nThey never arrive when I’m sat at my desk force-feeding myself into “being creative”.\n\nCreativity is like kind of like getting an erection; the more you try to force it, the less likely it is to happen.\n\n**5. A lack of confidence killed more dreams than a lack of competence ever did.**\n\nYou don’t need more talent, you need more self-belief.\n\n“There is a guy out there with half your talent but 10x your self-belief making 5x the money.” — George Mack\n\n**6. 90% of procrastination is due to one of two issues.**\n\nFirst “I don’t know what to do”.\n\n^ Break the big project into smaller chunks and define the next physical action.\n\nSecond “I know what to do but I don’t know how to do it.”\n\n^ ChatGPT, go to your boss, Google search, ask colleagues."
