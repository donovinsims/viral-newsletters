Give him half an hour of peace before bed. But make sure he knows we’ll start again, bright and early in the morning.” — Matthew Hussey\n\nThis insight makes my soul hurt, largely because I see it in myself.\n\n**The writer Oliver Burkeman has a name for this bottomless pit of self-imposed expected efficiency – Productivity Debt.**\n\n“Many people (by which I meant me) seem to feel as if they start off each morning in a kind of “productivity debt”, which they must struggle to pay off through the day, in hopes of reaching a zero balance by the time evening comes.\n\nFew things feel more basic to my experience of adulthood than this vague sense that I’m falling behind, and need to claw my way back up to some minimum standard of output.\n\nIt’s as if I need to justify my existence, by staying “on top of things”, in order to stave off some ill-defined catastrophe that might otherwise come crashing down upon my head.\n\nAnd make no mistake: paying off your imaginary productivity debt completely – in other words, working so hard and so efficiently that you no longer feel like you’re falling behind – is literally impossible, not just gruelling and unpleasant.\n\nIn the modern world of work, there’s no limit to the number of emails you might receive, the demands your boss might make, the ambitions you might have for your career, etcetera – so there’s no reason to believe you’ll ever get to the end of them.”\n\nHere’s to overcoming the “vague sense of falling behind”."
