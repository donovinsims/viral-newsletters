Sometimes you’re a burden.\n\nAnd if you don’t even feel safe being like that around your partner, if you have to withhold things from them and put on that show, you’re never going to feel safe around them and you’re not going to want to be there for them as much when they’re being a burden as well.\n\nYou just become these two people dividing and conquering all your problems rather than taking on the world together.\n\nI think I always felt like I wanted to be good at everything I did and be great at what I did.\n\nAnd I never expected to be as good as I was.\n\nSo it would just be such an interesting relief to be able to give myself to be like, you are going to be great, you’re going to have all these things that you want. But you’re also going to realise that they’re not as important as you think they are.\n\nYou’re going to come to the realisation where your relationships and your values and everything that you enjoy and experience aren’t going to come down to those spectacular moments on stage.\n\nThey’re going to be much simpler than that.\n\nThey’re just going to be those moments where you’re just being yourself, and the people who just love you for that are going to be everything.” — Chris Bumstead\n\nA successful career and a terrible marriage can make your life miserable.\n\nAn average career and an amazing marriage can make your life delightful.\n\nChoose wisely."
