I can’t wait for this.\n\nAnyway…\n\nYou’re probably pretty competent.\n\nYou can do things.\n\nYou’re prepared to try new stuff.\n\nAnd when you try new stuff, you don’t suck that much and you seem to make progress more quickly than most people.\n\n**This is the Curse Of Competence.**\n\nYour options for life-direction are less constrained by your abilities, and more by your choices.\n\nThis sounds like a blessing.\n\nIndeed it’s better than the alternative.\n\nBut it’s a unique category of problem; one which occurs while people tell you how fortunate you are to deal with it.\n\nBarry Schwartz in the Paradox Of Choice talks about the process of buying jeans 60 years ago.\n\nYou went to the jeans store and there was one type, one colour, one cut.\n\nYou found your waist size, paid and walked out.\n\nNow you may have wanted a slightly different style of jeans, or length, or colour, but you had no choice other than what was given to you.\n\nSo your total utility from the jeans may not be maximised but your satisfaction with the decision is pretty high, knowing you got the best you could given the circumstances.\n\nCompare this to today.\n\nYou go to a jean store and look around.\n\nDo you want skinny or bootcut? Straight legged? Cropped? Ripped? Blue? Grey? Acid wash? With contrast stitching or without?\n\nThe options are endless.\n\nHurray! You can finally select exactly the pair of jeans you’re looking for.\n\nBoo! This also means that any suboptimal decision is entirely your fault.\n\nIf you were unhappy with your jeans in 1960 – it’s the fault of the crappy jeans store.\n\nIf you’re unhappy with your jeans in 2024 – it’s the fault of your crappy choice.\n\nPreviously, your outcomes were largely out of your hands and limited by the world, today, they’re only limited by your choices.\n\n**This is how a constraint of options makes the decision making process easier.**\n\nThe Curse Of Competence plays into this too.\n\nIf you only are good at one category of things, you sure might be unhappy that you can’t do something else, and that indeed is a rubbish situation.\n\nBut the constraint helps to narrow your choices down.\n\nOn the other hand if you’re good at lots of things, there are many paths open to you which is liberating but can also cause you to be scared, confused and frozen in place.\n\n**We could call this a Titanic Problem.**\n\nAn issue that everyone says you’re in such a privileged position to deal with.\n\n“This is an extra special type of tragedy, a tragedy that unfolds while everyone cheers.\n\nLike being on the Titanic after the iceberg, water up to your chin, with everybody telling you that you’re so lucky to be on the greatest steamship of all time.\n\nAnd the Titanic is indeed so huge and wonderful that you can’t help but agree, but you’re also feeling a bit cold and wet at the moment, and you’re not sure why.” — Adam Mastroianni\n\nHaving lots of competencies you could follow in your life is exciting, but it’s also terrifying and paralysing too.\n\nPlus you have the added pain of feeling guilty for your seeming ungratefulness at the difficulty, even though the world is at your feet."
