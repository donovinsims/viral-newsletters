single-mother homes are about five times more likely to be poor than kids raised in stably married homes.\n\nThat young men raised apart from a stably married home are, according to recent research, more likely to land in jail or prison than to graduate from college.\n\nThat the biggest driver of recent declines in happiness is the nation’s retreat from marriage.\n\nAnd that, at the community level, the strongest predictor of economic mobility for poor children is family structure: Poor kids hailing from communities with more two-parent families have a markedly better shot at moving up into the middle class than poor kids from neighborhoods dominated by single parents.” — Brad Wilcox, The Atlantic\n\nWhy then, is it so hard to publicly advocate for the nuclear family?\n\nToxic Compassion.\n\n**Toxic Compassion is the prioritisation of short term emotional comfort over everything else.**\n\nOver truth, reality, actual long-term outcomes, flourishing, everything.\n\nIt optimises for looking good, rather than doing good.\n\nThis is seen in much of popular culture as the desirable, fair, empathetic thing to do.\n\nAnd it’s everywhere.\n\nPeople would rather claim that body fat has no bearing on health and mortality outcomes to avoid making overweight individuals feel upset.\n\nEven if this causes them to literally die sooner or have a worse quality of life over the long run.\n\nParents would rather allow children to play computer games or watch screens and access social media every night instead of dealing with the discomfort of taking it away from them.\n\nEven if it ruins their brain development, social skills and self esteem.\n\n**People would rather say that children growing up in single-parent households suffer no worse outcomes than those from two-parent homes.**\n\n**Even if this misleads parents, children and teachers about why kids behave the way they do.**\n\nCampaigners would sooner shout Defund The Police as a response to what they perceive as the unfair treatment of criminals.\n\nEven if this results in more crimes being committed against people from minority backgrounds due to the abandonment of police officers from those areas.\n\nElon Musk once responded to criticism about his political alignment and contribution to climate change.\n\nHe identified how big of a shift Tesla had caused in the Electric Vehicle market, and the downstream impact of that on the environment, saying that he’s done more for the climate than any other human in history.\n\n“What I care about is the reality of goodness, not the perception of it.\n\nAnd what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good, while doing evil.” — Elon Musk\n\nThe important tradeoff with all of these examples is between appearing good and actually doing good.\n\nTelling people what they want to hear, giving them immediate gratification and avoiding saying anything that could cause distress prioritises the former over the latter.\n\nThe net effect is often wildly negative.\n\nIt’s the toddler who wants to eat ice cream every night.\n\nSure that might be what they want in the moment, but it’ll be wildly unhealthy over the long term.\n\nI asked Jordan Peterson about this last year.\n\n“That’s exactly what the Oedipal situation is.\n\nIt’s the prioritisation of short term emotional comfort over long term thriving.\n\nIt’s going to hurt now, but the long consequences are positive.\n\nIf you give up your children to the world, you will keep them.”\n\nThe prospect of appearing bad while doing good is obviously not very enticing.\n\nThe opposite is Performative Empathy.\n\nSaying whatever is required to look good, even if you don’t actually care.\n\nAnd on the internet, the gap between words and actions has never been bigger.\n\nYou can be the least virtuous, meanest, most dishonest human on earth, but if you say the right things on social media, you look like a saint.\n\nNo one stress tests the words coming out of people’s mouths.\n\nWhich means that appearing good becomes more important than doing good.\n\nPerformative empathy is more rewarded than genuine empathy.\n\nPosting about mistreated groups is more incentivised than helping mistreated groups. *puts flag in bio, has never actually donated to a charity*\n\nThis isn’t me saying that you can’t do good whilst talking about it.\n\n**But that many (maybe even most) of the people who proselytise about how virtuous and caring they are, and how it’s everyone else who is evil, uncaring and the enemy are allowing their morality to stand on the shoulders of limited scrutiny.**\n\n“It’s like ‘look at how good I am’\n\nWell if the ‘look at’ comes before the ‘how good I am’, it really wreaks havoc on the claim.” — Jordan Peterson\n\nBeware the people who prioritise saying good things, they might not be doing good things."
