I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.*\n\n*I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead – but I still want to comfort and take care of you – and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together or learn Chinese – or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.*\n\n*When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true – you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else – but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.*\n\n*I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I – I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone – but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.*\n\n*My darling wife, I do adore you.*\n\n*I love my wife. My wife is dead.*\n\n*Rich.*\n\n*PS Please excuse my not mailing this but I don’t know your new address.*"
