Like some masochist at a sex party demanding car batteries get clamped onto his nipples before he can even get started?\n\nOr… the person who can do it with a good coffee and a fresh breeze?\n\nThis feels like a test of emotional robustness.\n\nIf the only experiences you allow to bring you joy are big, impressive, and rare, then your happiness is brittle.\n\nYou’ve made it dependent on external circumstances lining up in just the right way.\n\n**You’ve taken your joy hostage until the ransom note of life offers you something “sufficiently worth it.”**\n\nWe are already primed to be easy to trigger, just not in the right direction.\n\nWe let the tiniest inconveniences ruin our mood – a slow barista, the Wi-Fi buffering, a traffic jam that adds seven minutes to our commute.\n\nOur threshold for irritation is comically low.\n\nBut our threshold for joy?\n\nAbsurdly high.\n\nA stranger’s smile? Doesn’t count.\n\nA great song coming on shuffle? Not enough.\n\nLanding a towel straight into the washing basket from across the room? Lame.\n\n**If something as insignificant as a red light can make you snap, why can’t a good coffee make you glow?**\n\n**We are already easily tipped into frustration, so we must work hard to be equally easy to tip into delight.**\n\nEnjoyment is a kind of efficiency.\n\nThe less grandiosity you need to feel good, the more “happiness coins” you pick up across your day.\n\nHow little of a thing could happen to make your day?\n\nHow much excitement could you squeeze out of clean bedsheets, or the smell of rain on hot pavement, or a happy dog outside your house?\n\nSmall wins might seem feeble, but refusing to take joy from mundane victories simply because they’re insufficiently grand is the same as refusing a free ride to the airport just because you’re getting on a plane when you arrive there.\n\nSo… what if something small could be something great?\n\nMost people already have a high threshold for joy.\n\nDon’t make it worse by feeling shame when little things break through your defences and make you smile.\n\n***"
