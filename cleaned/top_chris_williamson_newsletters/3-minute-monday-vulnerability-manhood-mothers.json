      "content": "Hi friend,\n\nVulnerability is hard.\n\nFully feeling your feelings gets in the way of life. They slow you down, make you doubt, open you up to mockery and cause you pain.\n\nEmbracing your emotions sounds great in principle but feels frail in practise.\n\n****That being said, I want to try and prove to you that embracing vulnerability is true strength.****\n\n“Vulnerability is speaking your truth, even when it’s scary.” — Joe Hudson\n\nWho is truly the braver person… the one who lets themselves feel, or the one who flees the second an emotion gets too close?\n\nThe one strong enough to carry the full weight of their emotional experience, or the one so fragile that they have to suppress it?\n\n“Without vulnerability there’s no courage.\n\nIf there’s no uncertainty, no risk, no exposure, you’re not being that brave because there’s nothing on the line.” — Brené Brown.\n\nWe’re so quick to praise suppression as strength.\n\nWe call it control, we call it discipline, we pretend emotional detachment is a sign of maturity.\n\n****But fully living your life means actually feeling what happens, not just performing composure while something inside you quietly breaks.****\n\nThe enemy here is toxic stoicism.\n\nNot the grounded reflective kind, the hollowed-out kind.\n\nThe kind that rewards shutdown, that teaches you to be proud of how little you feel, as though restraint were the same thing as resilience.\n\nFearing vulnerability turns your inner world into a minefield.\n\nIt teaches you to treat emotions like threats, so you tiptoe carefully through your life trying not to set anything off.\n\nProud of your control but slowly growing more disconnected from life around you.\n\n****This isn’t strength, it’s avoidance rebranded.****\n\n“Resilience is not what most people think it is.\n\nIt’s not about not feeling the pain or being impervious to challenges or setbacks.\n\nIt isn’t about people who suppress, or ignore their feelings.\n\nIt’s also not about people who are delusional and think they don’t have feelings.\n\nResilience is about people who feel their feelings very deeply.\n\nBut are able to act, despite them, in their best interests.” — Mark Manson\n\nThe common mistake, especially among high-functioning, high-achieving people, is believing that vulnerability is weakness.\n\nBut vulnerability is being scared of speaking your truth, and doing it anyway.\n\nIt’s choosing presence before protection.\n\nIt’s the willingness to be seen, even when what’s visible isn’t tidy or filtered or finished.\n\nPicture two people receiving bad news. One’s hands shake as tears come. The other’s face goes blank, jaw locked, and later that night they’re three drinks deep, scrolling their phone, feeling nothing. Which one is really stronger – the one who can show their emotions, or the one who has to run from them?\n\n****Weakness is pretending you don’t feel. Strength is feeling deeply and staying open anyway.****\n\nWe call it coping, but often it’s just abstaining from reality.\n\nThe executive who prides herself on being “unflappable” while quietly burning out. She calls it professionalism, but it’s really a fear of having her true self rejected.\n\nThe partner who insists “I don’t do drama,” when what they mean is “I can’t tolerate intimacy.” Every deep discussion becomes an emotional threat, so they fake calm at the cost of closeness.\n\nThe person who posts about the value of vulnerability online while being emotionally unavailable offline, fluent in the language of openness but allergic to the practice of it.\n\nThe society obsessed with “authenticity” but terrified of sincerity, rewarding shallow confessions that trend while punishing the real ones that linger.\n\nThe children who learn that silence equals safety, growing into adults who apologise for their needs before they’ve even voiced them.\n\nThe influencer culture that sells “performative rawness” as a brand, monetising emotion while sterilising its reality.\n\nDifferent symptoms from the same disease – people who are so afraid of being broken by their feelings that they never let themselves be shaped by them.\n\nThe real fear isn’t just the emotion itself, it’s also what the emotion might not receive.\n\nWe’re not afraid of sadness, we’re afraid of being sad in front of someone who shrugs.\n\nWe’re not afraid of grief, we’re afraid of grieving and being judged for doing so.\n\nThat’s the abandonment we’re trying to avoid.\n\n****Even if we know that feeling our feelings is braver than denying them, the people around us still might think less of us for opening up.****\n\nSo we keep things hidden.\n\nNot because we want to, but because we don’t want to feel alone in the sharing.\n\nMen have this harder still as almost all definitions of masculinity have some version of “emotional control” as a core tenet, which makes feeling pride in showing emotions as a man even tougher.\n\nBut you can’t connect with the world or anyone in it if you never truly show yourself.\n\n****Intimacy only exists to the degree that you reveal yourself – your sadness, anger, joy, desires, boundaries, everything.****\n\nWhen you hide your flaws or feelings out of fear of shame, you block intimacy and authenticity.\n\nThe more you expose, the closer you are. The less you show, the more distant you become.\n\nVulnerability isn’t weakness; it’s rebellion.\n\nIt’s not how little you feel that makes you strong, it’s how much you can face and stay open.\n\n\"It’s saying: “I’ll go first. I’ll be honest even when it’s scary.\"\n\nNot because I’m fragile, but because I’m brave enough to be fully seen.”"
