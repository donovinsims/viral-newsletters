New York City, Austin, Boston, Denver, Salt Lake City & Chicago have limited tickets left.\nCome and see me live.\nThere’s a problem with how we all take advice when pursuing personal development.\nGuidance doesn’t sculpt us into something new, it exaggerates who we already are.\n**The pattern is almost cruel: the ones who least need the medicine are the ones most likely to overdose on it, while the ones who need it desperately are immune.**\nAdvice doesn’t land evenly, it finds the path of least resistance and tends to be absorbed by people who already lean in its direction.\nThe post-#MeToo instruction “don’t be pushy with women” makes conscientious, anxious men even more timid, while the guys steamrolling boundaries still don’t take heed.\nThe prescription to “just work harder” is devoured by the insecure overachiever who’s already bleeding effort into every crack of their day, while the genuinely lazy person coasts past it unchanged.\nThe “men should open up more” lesson is swallowed whole by the sensitive, expressive guys, while the stoic boomer who equates vulnerability with weakness ignores it completely.\nAnd the call to “take more responsibility” encourages the ones who always think it’s their fault end to carry even more of the load, while the ones who constantly point the finger elsewhere never change.\n**TLDR: People who really need to hear advice often don’t notice, while those who could do with the opposite message will take it as gospel.**\nLet’s call these people Advice Hyperresponders. History and myth are full of them.\nIcarus was already reckless, intoxicated by freedom and glory. His father Daedalus told him to keep to the middle path; don’t fly too high or too low. But Icarus exaggerated the part that matched his impulse, soaring higher until the wax melted and he fell into the sea.\nDon Quixote was already romantic, imaginative, and desperate for purpose. When he read too many tales of knights, he didn’t just enjoy them as fiction, he treated them as instruction. The lesson to be noble and brave was amplified into absurdity, until he was charging at windmills and humiliating himself.\nEven the Buddha before enlightenment was already austere and obsessed with self-mastery. As a young ascetic, he followed the prescription of self-denial so literally that he nearly starved himself to death, only later realising the guidance had become poison and creating the “Middle Way” to correct course.\nWhy does this happen?\nWell… People filter advice through their existing traits, so it amplifies predisposition rather than correcting imbalance.\nWe all want to be “good,” so we over-index the guidance that flatters our self-conception as conscientious, virtuous and hardworking.\nBut perhaps most influential is the fact that instructions which bite deepest are the ones that match our inner fears. The anxious man doesn’t just hear “don’t be pushy,” he feels it confirm the fear that any move he makes is already too much. The sensitive man doesn’t just hear “open up more,” he feels it confirm the worry that he’s emotionally inadequate, even when he’s already oversharing. The insecure overachiever doesn’t just hear “work harder,” he feels it confirm the suspicion that he’s never enough. The self-blamer doesn’t just hear “take more responsibility,” he feels it confirm the fear that he’s guilty even when he isn’t.\nThe trouble is that good counsel, when misapplied, can be worse than bad counsel or none at all.\n**The resistant ignore it while the receptive overdo it.**\nAnd the net effect is that imbalance gets amplified, not corrected.\nSelf-improvement doesn’t distribute like medicine, it distributes like alcohol. The ones who should abstain are drunk on it while the ones who could do with loosening up don’t even sip.\nThe problem isn’t a lack of advice. It’s the inability to tell when guidance is seductive because it confirms your existing tendencies like your biases, your fears and your flaws.\nMuch advice doesn’t balance us, it exaggerates us. It makes the disciplined more rigid, the sensitive more fragile, the responsible more burdened.\nThe trick is not discovery but discernment. Not hearing more, but knowing when to stop listening."
