      "content": "Hi friend,\n\n“We live with a quiet superstition: that beneath the noise of our habits, mistakes and contradictions lies a truer version of ourselves – a self that is fundamentally good.”\n\nAn alcoholic who gets sober is “becoming who he really is”, a sober man who starts drinking again has “lost his way.”\n\nIn Scrooge, Dickens didn’t just write about a man who swapped stinginess for generosity; he wrote about a man who discovered his real nature.\n\nWhen Richard Nixon fell in disgrace, people said power had corrupted his real self but when Nelson Mandela forgave his captors, the world said his true self had been revealed.\n\n“Or real life: patients with dementia who lose memory but retain kindness are often seen by loved ones as “still the same person,” while those who grow cruel are perceived as having lost their essence.”\n\nEven when fiction tries to make villains irredeemable, audiences resist – Darth Vader is terrifying until he saves his son and proves there was goodness “deep down.”\n\nWe are reluctant to accept that anyone, even Satan in Paradise Lost, is rotten all the way through.\n\nOur language betrays the bias; goodness is authenticity while badness is a mask.\n\nPsychologists have tested this belief and the results are strikingly consistent – people overwhelmingly identify morally positive changes as revealing someone’s “true self” but dismiss negative changes as surface corruption.\n\n****The clearest demonstration comes from a study about a man called Mark.****\n\nMark’s life was presented in two versions; in one, he was a devout Christian who believed homosexuality was wrong but admitted he was attracted to men, in the other he was a liberal who believed homosexuality was perfectly acceptable but confessed to feeling repulsed by same-sex couples.\n\nIn both cases Mark was split – a belief pulled him one way while a feeling pulled him the other.\n\n“The question to participants was simple: which side represented his true self?”\n\nLiberals almost always said the attraction to men revealed who Mark really was, while his disgust at homosexuality was right wing programming.\n\nConservatives almost always said his conviction against homosexuality revealed who he really was, and his public support was woke peer pressure.\n\nBasically, each group looked at the same man and saw their own values reflected back at them.\n\n****It wasn’t that people consistently treated beliefs as more authentic or feelings as less genuine, instead they treated whichever side lined up with their own moral compass as the “real” side.****\n\nThis has some fascinating implications.\n\nIt suggests that authenticity isn’t something we find inside others, instead it’s something we project onto them.\n\nWhat counted as Mark’s essence wasn’t hiding “in” him at all, it existed in the values of the people judging him.\n\nThese fights are never just about evidence; they’re about who gets to define authenticity.\n\nInterestingly the whole exercise only works when someone is conflicted – if Mark had only one belief or one feeling, no one would hesitate to declare “that’s who he is.”\n\nConflict is the playground where we get to impose our judgments about which side counts as the real self.\n\nThere are consequences to always seeing ourselves and others we favour as moral.\n\nIt cushions us from despair, because failures can be brushed aside as “not really me” which makes bouncing back after mistakes easier.\n\nBut it also blinds us to our own cruelty, because harmful actions are rationalised as accidents or aberrations.\n\nIt creates an asymmetry where we forgive ourselves quickly while judging others more harshly.\n\nIt skews our sense of authenticity, because we treat virtuous impulses as real and darker ones as intrusions.\n\nIt can make us dangerously naïve about people who are not conflicted at all, those for whom malice is not a mask but a pattern.\n\nAnd it fuels a lifelong quest to “uncover the good self,” as though the work of living is not making choices, but excavating purity.\n\nTo add even more complexity, notice how unevenly this belief gets applied.\n\nIf goodness is the truth and badness is a mask, then in theory we should treat all people’s goodness as authentic and all people’s badness as superficial, but that isn’t what we do.\n\nWith our allies, we assume their virtues show who they really are, while their failures are only slips, distortions, or masks.\n\nWith our opponents, we reverse it – their good deeds are dismissed as fake or manipulative, while their mistakes and vices are taken as proof of their true character.\n\n****This double standard shows that the rule isn’t actually “goodness is authenticity”, the rule is “the kind of goodness I value is authenticity.”****\n\nOur side’s goodness is treated as essence while the other side’s goodness is treated as performance.\n\nOur side’s failings are masks but the other side’s failings are revelations.\n\nPsychologically this makes sense.\n\nIn small groups, assuming hidden goodness in insiders helped maintain trust and cohesion while assuming hidden badness in outsiders helped define the boundary between “us” and “them.”\n\nBut the cost is distortion – we give our friends a free pass while demonising our rivals, blinded to their real virtues and our own side’s flaws.\n\nWhat looks like a rule about human nature (“goodness is truth, badness is a mask”) turns out to actually be a rule about group loyalty.\n\n****So here’s a disconcerting idea – what if our “true self” doesn’t exist at all?****\n\n****What if we are nothing but the bundle of drives, beliefs, and feelings that show up in the moment?****\n\nThe addict is just as much himself when he drinks as when he doesn’t.\n\nScrooge was authentically Scrooge as a miser and as a benefactor.\n\nWe only anoint the generous version “authentic” because it flatters our sense of what humans ought to be.\n\nIn this light, the true self isn’t discovered, it’s invented.\n\nThe fiction makes forgiveness possible, but it also blinds us to cruelty and shortcomings.\n\n****It allows us to keep loving people even at their worst, but it also tricks us into underestimating malice.****\n\nWe say every tyrant or abuser has a hidden spark of goodness, even when sometimes there is none.\n\nYou can see this bias everywhere.\n\nAddicts in recovery routinely say “that wasn’t the real me” about their lowest points, but no one ever says sobriety is fake.\n\nChildhood stories teach us the frog is really a prince, the beast really gentle – the happy ending is always framed as a revelation of what was hidden all along.\n\nTherapists describe patients “getting back to themselves” after depression, but it is almost unthinkable to frame it the other way – that the depressed version is the truest one.\n\nEven in daily life, when a kind friend lashes out in anger we soothe ourselves by saying “that’s not who she is” but when they show generosity, we never say “that’s not them”.\n\n****“I hope this is not the truth, but here’s my fear: there may be no “real you” at all.”****\n\nThe true self isn’t something to be discovered, instead it’s something we invent – a superstition we cling to because it makes forgiveness easier, love sustainable, and cruelty bearable."

      "content": "****1. Men like dating younger women.****\n\nA study of age gap relationships showed that men are substantially happier when dating a woman (or man) 7+ years younger than them as opposed to 7+ years older.\n\nInterestingly, no such effect was found in women, indicating that women could be equally satisfied in a relationship with a significantly younger or a significantly older partner, unlike men.\n\nWomen who dated older men felt significantly more financially stable when compared to dating a younger partner – this effect was not found in younger men dating older women or younger women dating older women.\n\n****2. Democrats and Republicans don’t understand each other.****\n\nDemocrats wrongly believed that 38% of Republicans made more than $250,000 per year, the real number was 2.2%.\n\nIn the same study, Republicans wrongly thought that 32% of Democrats were gay, lesbian or bisexual, the real number was 6.3%. — Rob Henderson\n\n****3. Should pro-life campaigners be anti-circumcision?****\n\n“In America, a baby boy dies every 3 days from circumcision, often from infection.\n\nThere’s all this talk about abortion being evil when babies are killed post-birth for no reason.\n\nInfant male circumcision makes no sense – you don’t cut off body parts to avoid cleaning them.\n\nThat would be like saying that your solution to dandruff is decapitation.” — George TheTinMen"
