Nowhere to hide now buddy.\n\nThis highlights our hypocrisy.\n\nYou see, we want the world to love us for who we are.\n\nA balanced, caring view of our true value, independent of our accomplishments.\n\nMeanwhile our own self-love is largely determined by what we do.\n\nIf we fall short, even though we know we tried our best, we still castigate ourselves for being insufficient, unworthy creatures.\n\nSo we want the world to show up for us in a way that we are often not prepared to show up for ourselves.\n\nYou deserve more than this, demand it of yourself."
