Good or bad.\n\nWhen you’re on top of the world it won’t last for as long as you hope, when the world is on top of you it won’t last for as long as you fear.\n\nYou feel like a sleepy balloon right now.\n\nSoon enough it will just be a memory of something you got through.\n\nIt’s just one day, one activity, one thought at a time.\n\nKeep plodding.\n\n**2 Mundane successes are big wins.**\n\nSuccess may previously have been this grand, impressive occasion that occurs in front of other people to fanfare and accolade.\n\nToday you went for a walk, or were kind to that person at the supermarket, or were gentle with yourself when you became frustrated.\n\nIs this as outwardly magnificent as your life’s greatest achievement?\n\nNo. But some days feel like you’re lifting on Mars, and other days feel like you’re lifting on Jupiter.\n\nToday is a Jupiter day.\n\nGravity is heavier than usual right now, so well done for carrying that weight.\n\nBoring victories achieve no fanfare but they are even more meaningful.\n\n**3 Go easy on yourself.**\n\nYou’re going to feel frustrated or resentful or anxious or scared or whatever.\n\nIt’s fine. That’s going to happen.\n\nYou’re safe, let it move through you.\n\nBut you must try to avoid second-order-emotions.\n\nFeeling agitated at being anxious.\n\nOr ashamed about being so resentful.\n\nAnd then feeling bored at your agitation about your anxiousness or guilty about your shame at your resentments.\n\nIf you had a child going through what you are, you wouldn’t chastise them, you’d pick them up and hug them.\n\nSo hug you.\n\n**4 You do not need to offer the world anything.**\n\nOk you don’t feel as impressive as usual right now.\n\nDoes it feel like the world is about to abandon you because you can’t give it something in return?\n\nYou did not enter into some trade with reality when you were born, only being accepted for as long as you can provide value as recompense.\n\nMaybe your jokes are less funny and your stories are less original and your aura is less energising.\n\nBut you’re not going to be abandoned.\n\nYour friends want to help, and need nothing in return.\n\nAnd if you have friends who only want to be around you if you’re entertaining them, those aren’t friends, they’re patrons.\n\n**5 Judge yourself on your actions not your thoughts.**\n\nYou felt bad and yet you still did the thing.\n\nGetting the job done in spite of not being in the mood is more impressive, not less.\n\nStop discounting what you did just because you didn’t feel like doing it.\n\n**6 Allow yourself to become a priority.**\n\nYou have to believe that your needs are important.\n\nUsually you subjugate your desires and put everything else ahead of you.\n\nStop fixing everyone before yourself for once.\n\nAdvocating for what you need is not selfish or narcissistic, it’s just alien to you.\n\nPut yourself first.\n\n**7 Ask for help.**\n\nYes you don’t usually need anyone.\n\nMaybe you don’t NEED anyone now either.\n\nBut it will be easier if you ask for help.\n\nAllow yourself to become a burden.\n\nMaybe your friends actually want to help you. Maybe they would love the opportunity to care for you.\n\nConsider for a second that it’s actually noble to not always be the super strong competent person who’s never got any vulnerabilities.\n\n**8 Don’t worry about not feeling grateful.**\n\nThings will happen.\n\nSome good.\n\nIt’ll be hard to fully feel appreciation for them.\n\nYour daily experience is swimming in melancholy.\n\nEverything is tough enough as it is.\n\nDon’t make yourself feel worse for not being happier about the little things in life right now.\n\nYou would have if you could.\n\n**9 You make your most progress when things are hard.**\n\nLook back.\n\nEvery big period of progress in your life has germinated from your lowest points.\n\nIn retrospect, would you have avoided them if you could?\n\nProbably not.\n\nYes it sucks, but right now will be a gift to your future self.\n\nTough times stop you from relying on momentum or bravado.\n\nLike going on a hard cut that melts away all the fat. Low points remind you who you truly are underneath.\n\n**10 You are not falling behind.**\n\nYou have this vague sense that you’re falling behind if you’re not always always making progress.\n\nThis is a lie.\n\nThere is no arbitrary minimum level of productivity you need to meet every day in order to feel worthwhile.\n\nEven olympians get injured and take time off.\n\nEven the best performing stocks have pullbacks.\n\nExpand your time horizon.\n\nLook at your Year-On-Year growth, not Intraday Price.\n\nYour progress has been great, you were overdue a small correction anyway.\n\nYou are still in there."
