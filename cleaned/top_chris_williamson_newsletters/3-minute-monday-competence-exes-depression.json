Straight legged? Cropped? Ripped? Blue? Grey? Acid wash? With contrast stitching or without?\n\nThe options are endless.\n\nHurray! You can finally select exactly the pair of jeans you’re looking for.\n\nBut this also means that any suboptimal decision is entirely your fault.\n\nIf you were unhappy with your jeans in 1960 – it’s the fault of the crappy jeans store.\n\nIf you’re unhappy with your jeans in 2024 – it’s the fault of your research.\n\nPreviously, your experience was largely out of your hands and limited by the world, today, it’s only limited by your choices.\n\n**This is how a constraint of options makes the decision making process easier.**\n\nThe Curse Of Competence plays into this too.\n\nIf you only are good at one category of things, you sure might be unhappy that you can’t do something else, and that indeed is a rubbish situation.\n\nBut the constraint helps to narrow your choices down.\n\nOn the other hand if you’re good at lots of things, there are many paths open to you which is liberating but can also cause you to be scared, confused and frozen in place.\n\n**In one world your life options are constrained by opportunity, in another world they are constrained by discernment.**\n\nWe could call this a Titanic Problem.\n\nAn issue that everyone says you’re in such a privileged position to deal with.\n\n“This is an extra special type of tragedy, a tragedy that unfolds while everyone cheers.\n\nLike being on the Titanic after the iceberg, water up to your chin, with everybody telling you that you’re so lucky to be on the greatest steamship of all time.\n\nAnd the Titanic is indeed so huge and wonderful that you can’t help but agree, but you’re also feeling a bit cold and wet at the moment, and you’re not sure why.” — Adam Mastroianni\n\nHaving lots of competencies you could follow in your life is exciting, but it’s also terrifying and paralysing too.\n\nPlus you have the added challenge of feeling guilty for your seeming ungratefulness even though the world is at your feet."
