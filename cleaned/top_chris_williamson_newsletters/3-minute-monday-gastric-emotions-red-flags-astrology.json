You are forced to face your issues without the highly distracting release-valve that you’re used to.\n\nThe busyness-anaesthetic you used to previously rely on has now been removed, leaving you with two choices:\n\n1. Ignore the lesson that chaos is not fulfilment and go back down the road you just escaped from by force-feeding your way through this figurative gastric band.\n2. Actually learn to handle emotional discomfort."
