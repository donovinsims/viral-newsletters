      "content": "Hi friend,\n\n**There are few feelings worse in this life than being right but early.**\n\nYou correctly predict a future catastrophe, trend, opportunity for growth or important area of focus, only to be castigated for how short-sighted, xenophobic, judgemental, out of touch, Left Wing, Right Wing or alarmist you are.\n\nThe Cassandra Complex is when someone accurately predicts a negative future event or truth, but no one believes them, and they’re often dismissed, ignored, or even ridiculed.\n\nIt’s named after Cassandra, a figure in Greek mythology. The god Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, but after she rejected his advances, he cursed her so that no one would ever believe her warnings. She foresaw the fall of Troy, warned everyone, and was met with scorn. The city burned anyway.\n\nRachel Carson, in her 1962 book Silent Spring, warned about the environmental damage caused by pesticides. She was mocked by chemical companies and even some scientists. But her work eventually led to the environmental movement and the banning of DDT.\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis, in the 1840s, realised that doctors were transmitting childbed fever from autopsies to mothers by not washing their hands. He begged his colleagues to adopt handwashing. They laughed at him. He died in an asylum. Decades later, germ theory proved him right.\n\nEdward Snowden warned about government surveillance. Some saw him as a hero; many called him a traitor. His warnings were initially dismissed, until proof emerged that governments were indeed spying on civilians.\n\nBeing right but early happens on much more personal scales too.\n\nSomeone sees clear warning signs in a work environment and warns others: “This is toxic. It’s going to implode.” They’re brushed off as negative or paranoid, until it does implode.\n\nIn a relationship, one person sees the correct course of action that their partner should take but is labelled controlling for trying to convince them of it. Eventually the other partner does come around to it, only after the price of bruised faith and wasted time has been paid.\n\n**In short, history doesn’t reward the first person to see clearly, it often punishes them.**\n\nCassandras bleed first so the rest of us don’t have to.\n\nWhy do we resist?\n\nBecause every new truth asks the existing world to die a little.\n\nIt happens because people don’t want to believe uncomfortable truths; Cognitive Dissonance.\n\nBecause we trust stability and get suspicious of those who challenge it; Status Quo Bias.\n\nAnd because if the person warning us isn’t seen as “credible,” they’re ignored, no matter how right they are; Messenger Effect.\n\n**The main issue here, beyond progress being held back, is that it disincentivises people from speaking up when they have insight that could benefit others.**\n\nNicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei are a perfect example of this.\n\nIn the early 1500s, Copernicus quietly proposed something radical: the Earth orbits the sun. Humans, once the unmoving centre of God’s design, were now spinning through space on a planet among many.\n\nBut Copernicus hesitated. He delayed publishing his heliocentric model for decades. His great work,*De revolutionibus*, came out only as he lay on his deathbed, likely to avoid the wrath of Church and academia. His truth was too disruptive. And so, for most of his life, it went unheard.\n\nGalileo, a century later, took that same Copernican spark and shouted it from the rooftops. He saw the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, the imperfections on the Moon’s surface, all evidence that the heavens were not as fixed or divine as taught.\n\nThe Church responded with fear. Galileo was dragged before the Inquisition, forced to recant under threat of torture, and sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life.\n\nIn retrospect, it’s not surprising that Copernicus kept his mouth shut, given how Galileo was treated.\n\nThis is a core truth of the Cassandra Complex; being right often isn’t enough and being early can feel like being wrong.\n\n**Anyway, I might as well put some skin in the game. Here’s some stuff I think I’m right but early about:**\n\n* Birth rate decline is a huge deal that everyone should be worried about.\n* Climate change should not be an existential risk priority compared with AGI, bioweapons, pandemics and nuclear war.\n* Widespread Hormonal Birth Control use is a large contributor to the mental health issues of modern women.\n* Normalising egg freezing for 21 year old women is a positive social change.\n* The UK is unrecoverably broken and will not be a future world power.\n* China is not the massive threat that everyone thinks it is.\n* LLMs are not the architecture that AGI will be launched from.\n* Jared Leto is going to be rumbled in some huge future court case.\n\n(totally open to being wrong, and/or late about all of these)\n\nFeel free to give me some of your “right but early” predictions, I’m interested."
