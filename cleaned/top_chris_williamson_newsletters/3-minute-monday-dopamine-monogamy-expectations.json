It would be great if we could come back next year”.\n\nSo literally DURING the supposed enjoyment of “the destination”, Morgan was captured by the allure of the next “journey”.\n\nHow absolutely tragic, and hilarious.\n\n**The dangerous thing about anticipation is it can cause us to look over the shoulder of the present moment, to always see what’s coming next so we never actually experience what is happening right now.**\n\nI’m not sure there is a panacea for this.\n\nBut one potential solution is to make sure you find ways to enjoy your pursuit.\n\nMicro-celebrations, miniature wins, lots of little way-markers as you move along.\n\nAs many destinations to enjoy the anticipation of as possible."
