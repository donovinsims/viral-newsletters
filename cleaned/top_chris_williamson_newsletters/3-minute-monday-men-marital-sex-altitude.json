Surely they can just try harder in school, employment and health? “Chop chop men, hurry up and stop being so useless.”\n\nWell, no other group is told that when they suffer with poor performance or accolades in the real world that they should just pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\n\nWe don’t tell any other group to ‘talk about their problems’, instead we spend billions in tax payer money and private charity; to set up committees, departments, campaigns and funds to solve the problem.\n\nIn simple terms, if a woman has a problem, we ask: “what can we do to fix society?” If a man has a problem, we ask: “what can men do to fix themselves?”\n\nIt’s a blatant double standard, and people who are unwilling to admit to any structural disadvantages faced by men are standing in the way of us solving the problems that are hurting men, and also the potential wives they should be viable for.\n\nThe problems are not in men’s head, but out there, in society – and we should not gaslight men into thinking they can solve these problems by being less toxically masculine.\n\n**If the patriarchy is so powerful, why aren’t men flourishing more?**\n\nAs Christine Emba says “Many young men feel their difficulties are often dismissed out of hand as whining from a patriarchy that they don’t feel a part of.\n\nJust because you’re in the majority doesn’t mean you don’t need support.”\n\nIn this regard, modern men are being made to pay for the sins of the advantages that their fathers and grandfathers enjoyed."

It fights stress, supports energy, and improves how your body repairs itself.\n\nAnd the Echo Flask is the best way to get it.\n\nIt adds high levels of hydrogen directly into your water.\n\nNo tablets, no gimmicks. Just a clean, portable system built with FDA-approved materials and I’ve been using mine every day.\n\nOver 1,500+ studies back it up, and it’s trusted by 100,000+ customers, including The Rock, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Joe Rogan.\n\nBig love,\nChris x"
