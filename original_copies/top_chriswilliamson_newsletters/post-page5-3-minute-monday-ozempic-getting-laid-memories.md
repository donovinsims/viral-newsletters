Hi friend,

I’ve been thinking about the public drama around the widespread adoption of Ozempic and GLP1s.

Unsurprisingly there has been a lot of pushback from the body positivity movement.

Headlines say that anorectics (the broader class of drugs like Ozempic) confirm society’s “anti-fat bias” and claim that “a future without fat is a dangerous idea”.

Basically that appetite-suppressing drugs are a removal of fat people’s identity and a denial of their right to exist.

All the usual stuff.

But much more of the pushback online seems to come from people who are not fat, but ones who are in shape – which got me thinking about why that would be the case?

Why would someone who isn’t going to use a drug be so critical about its introduction?

Here’s my bioscience theory…

**People who have managed to get in shape and stay in shape without pharmaceutical assistance have used some amount of effort, willpower and discipline.**

Because there are limited “easy” ways to lose weight, anybody who is in shape has status associated with having achieved it.

It’s a reliable, costly signal – a behaviour that is so expensive for the sender that it can be used to communicate honest information about them.

**The introduction of “easy” ways to get in shape derogates the prestige of this signal.**

It basically lowers the status of being in shape.

It also makes it harder to work out the underlying fitness signals that someone’s outer appearance usually indicates.

Is this person hard working, reliable, trustworthy and able to master their impulses by using their willpower to not overeat?

Or did they just get a prescription for Ozempic?

**TLDR: Fat people should not be worried about Ozempic denying their right to exist but thin people may be worried about it hiding their fitness signals.**

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1. 
 **Clever boys don’t get laid.**

“Adolescents with an IQ of 130 are 3-5 times less likely to have had intercourse than those with average IQ.

Boys with an IQ that would qualify for intellectual disability (60) are still more likely to have had sex than those with a very high IQ (130).” — Journal of Adolescent Health via Rob Henderson

2. 
 **Capital punishment in the US was very intense until recently.**

“The last execution by electrocution in the United States was done in 2020, in Tennessee.

The last firing squad execution was in 2010, in Utah.

The last hanging was carried out in 1996, in Delaware.” — Bryan Klaas

3. 
 **What would you tomorrow want you today to do?**

“Somewhere in the future, your older self is watching you through memories.

Whether it’s with regret or nostalgia depends on what you do now.” — Gurwinder Bhogal

## LIFE HACK

**You might not need more caffeine or sleep, you might just be dehydrated.**

The more I learn about the role of salt and electrolytes in alertness, energy and function, the more certain I am that this is going to be one of the next big health revolutions.

Proper hydration is not just about drinking fluids, it’s about having sufficient electrolytes in your body to actually use those fluids properly.

Drinking LMNT Salt first thing in the morning is the way I’ve started my day for over 3 years now.

It tastes delicious and contains zero sugar or any other junk.

I keep harping on about it because it really works.

Try it and feel the difference.
