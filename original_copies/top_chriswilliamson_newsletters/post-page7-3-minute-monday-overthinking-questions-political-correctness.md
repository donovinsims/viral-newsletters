Hi friend,

I’ve been thinking about overthinking recently.

Probably overthinking about overthinking to be honest.

And I came across a tweet:

“This is your annual reminder that you don’t need to resolve your issues, you don’t need to deal with your emotional baggage, you don’t need to process your trauma, you don’t need to confront your past, you don’t need to figure yourself out, you can just go ahead and do the thing.” — Eliezer Yudkowsky

We believe we need to prepare much more in imagination than reality.

We can kid ourselves into believing that until we’ve got our head in the right place, we can’t move forward in the way we want to.

We can’t leave that job or start that project or ask that person out who we fancy prior to ridding ourselves of the things we believe are holding us back.

But life isn’t waiting for you.

At all.

Time will continue to tick along while you wait and try to create the optimal environment to finally make a move.

**Perfectionism is procrastination masquerading as quality control.**

Think about it this way.

Guy 1 spends all day at work thinking about how he needs to go to the gym later on.

The last time he went to the gym it was a bit uncomfortable.

Today has been long.

And he’s tired.

And the gym was actually kind of mean and made him feel hurt.

But he knows he needs to go.

So he debates in his head all day.

Should I go, shouldn’t I go?

Am I ready, am I not ready?

Eventually, using what feels like a superhuman effort, he finally drags himself to the gym and gets a session in.

Guy 2 also needs to go to the gym.

He also got a bit messed up last time he went.

But he doesn’t think about it at all during the day, he knows he should go when work finishes, so he waits for work to finish.

Then when the time comes, he grabs his bag and goes to the gym.

The end result of both people is the same – they achieve the goal they wanted of going to the gym.

But one has suffered and wasted 8 hours of precious life being distracted, and used a metric ton of willpower to achieve it.

Presuming that we need motivation or preparation to do things is often untrue.

**You don’t need motivation to do the thing.**

**You just need to do the thing.**

**Also, trying to think your way out of overthinking is like trying to sniff your way out of a cocaine addiction.**

**This week’s upcoming episodes:**

Monday. Craig Jones – crazy stories from the front lines of the Ukraine war, why he’s fighting a woman for $1m in a few months and how to cause huge drama in the world of grappling. So good.

Thursday. Menno Henselmans – one of the best voices in evidence-based training & diet on what science says about how to eat and use protein for maximum muscle growth plus a ton of myth debunking.

Saturday. Scott Galloway – how can young people acquire wealth in a broken economy? Really good practical insights from one of my favourite people here.

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1. ​**3 brave questions to ask your partner.**

1 – What is something you have been telling me that’s important to you that I keep missing or overlooking?

2 – What is something you need from me that I struggle to give to you?

3 – What is something you feel I haven’t fully accepted about you? — Vienna Pharaon

​

2. ​**Women are more politically correct than men.**

“Women are far more likely than men to support political correctness as measured by the Critical Social Justice Attitude Scale, which asks people how much they agree with statements such as “University reading lists should include fewer white or European authors” and “Microaggressions should be challenged often and actively.”

3 out of 5 women view such statements positively, compared with only 1 out of 7 men.” — Rob Henderson

​

3. ​**Beware the incentives.**

“During the 1980’s, the government of Athens came up with an idea to limit pollution: Odd-numbered and even-numbered license plates.

On dates with an odd number, the odd plates could drive.

And vice versa.

The rich people just bought another car — with even worse emissions.

The streets got more jammed and the pollution got worse.” — George Mack

## LIFE HACK

**Get your bloodwork done.**

If you’re not performing in the gym or the bedroom or with your energy or mental clarity the way you would like, you need to work out what’s going on inside of your body.

I asked friends for who has the best service in America and was sent to Marek Health.

I was so impressed with them that I reached out to the CEO to partner with them.

They do everything including tests, analysis, suggest lifestyle interventions, diet and training protocols.

**Plus they can supply supplements and pharmaceuticals like TRT and GLP-1s (Semaglutide) all in one.**

If you want to stop guessing about what’s happening with your health, this is the place to go.
