Hi friend,

"On social media, fools feel clever by mocking bigger fools, and scoundrels feel virtuous by condemning bigger scoundrels.
We feel good simply by portraying others as worse.
In an age of anxiety & inaction, many seek self-esteem not in their own abilities, but in other's failures." — Gurwinder Bhogal

This is one of my least favourite trends.
I am so bored of cynicism on the internet.
I'm sick of seeing comment sections just filled with self-defeating, world-hating nihilists who are adamant that the world is against them and it's people who have goals that are the issue.
People whose only successes involve standing on the shoulders of others' shortcomings.
Gesturing at the public failure of any everyone else in the hope that their legitimacy never gets scrutinised.

### This is the Cynicism Safety Blanket.

"Cynicism is a guarded response.
You're setting yourself up against disappointment.
Its role within the system is to protect you against experiencing anything bad.
It is a pre-emptive strike against a perceived threat.
If I tell myself that ‘all women are bad', then I'm less likely to seek a relationship with women and, as a consequence, I'm never going to feel the pain of rejection.
If I tell myself that ‘everything is shit' or that ‘things will never get better', then I am excused of ever having to try at anything.
It's more comfortable to get fatalistic and call it pragmatism.
The cope is framing hope as pathetic and embarrassing and optimism as delusion.
It's "sour grapes" at an existential level.
If everything sucks, and everyone is horrible, and reality is disappointing and you know that for a fact, it's the people acting like things can be better that are dumb, delusional and the problem.
The upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of failure."

Get fucked bro. I don't want your influence within 1000 miles of my life.

"It's good to criticise the vile aspects of the world, but there is nothing more vile than to do nothing about it and convince others to do the same." — Ryan Lazarus

I believe in hope.
I want to be around people who have a positive vision for themselves, and others, and the world.
I advise you do the same.
