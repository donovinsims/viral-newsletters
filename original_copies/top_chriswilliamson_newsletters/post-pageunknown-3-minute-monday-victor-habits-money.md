\n\t\t\t\t\t\nHi friend,

\n\n\n\nMy first two shows of tour in NYC and Toronto were amazing. Thank you so much to everyone who came out!

\n\n\n\nIn 1830 Victor Hugo was catastrophically behind deadline on The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.

\n\n\n\nHis publisher had given him only a few months left, but Hugo was a spectacular procrastinator, entertaining visitors, wandering Paris, and finding excuses not to write.

\n\n\n\nDesperate, he invented a bizarre discipline system.

\n\n\n\nHe gathered all his normal clothes, gave them to his servant, and ordered them locked away.

\n\n\n\nHe kept only a massive wool shawl that draped around him like a monk’s robe.

\n\n\n\nToo embarrassed to leave his house dressed like a hermit, he confined himself indoors.

\n\n\n\nHe also bought a huge bottle of ink—a literal symbol of his siege.

\n\n\n\nEvery morning he sat half-naked at his desk, the cold air biting, with nothing to do but face the manuscript.

\n\n\n\nFrom that point on, his study became a cell.

\n\n\n\nAccording to legend, Hugo would draft furiously, then slide finished pages under the door, where his servant collected them for safekeeping.

\n\n\n\nHe was so cut off that even small needs had to be negotiated through the barrier – food and fresh paper were passed back the other way, so the routine never broke.

\n\n\n\nAdèle, his wife, said he had “entered his novel as if it were a prison.”

\n\n\n\nIt was less “jail” and more “self-imposed monastic cell.”

\n\n\n\nThe result?

\n\n\n\nIn a feverish burst he wrote day after day, often for 12 hours straight, and finished the entire novel within the locked-down months.

\n\n\n\nBy January 15, 1831, the manuscript was complete—a frantic burst that birthed one of the great novels of the century.

\n\n\n\nWithout that desperate, almost theatrical punishment system, the book that cemented Hugo’s legacy might never have been completed.

\n\n\n\nYou’ll be amazed at what you can complete when you have no other option.

\n\n\n\n## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

\n\n\n\n1.​**Gen Z wants a lot of money.**

\n\n\n\nSalaries Americans say they consider the minimum to be “financially successful”:

\n\n\n\nBoomers – $99.9K

\n\n\n\nGen X – $212.3k

\n\n\n\nMillennials – $180.9K

\n\n\n\nGen Z – $587.8K

\n\n\n\nAverage – $270.2K

\n\n\n\n(Survey of 2,203 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 13-14, 2024)

\n\n\n\n​

\n\n\n\n2.​**Habits from the habits guy.**

\n\n\n\n“Habits that have a high rate of return in life:– sleeping 8+ hours each day– lifting weights 3x week– going for a walk each day– saving at least 10 percent of your income– reading every day– drinking more water and less of everything else– leaving your phone in another room while you work” — James Clear

\n\n\n\n​

\n\n\n\n3.​**Beware delays masquerading as research.**

\n\n\n\n“Wanting more information is often just a form of procrastination.” — Russ Roberts

\n\n\n\n## LIFE HACK

\n\n\n\nFlighty App.

\n\n\n\nI’m on tour at the moment and this thing is so SO good.

\n\n\n\nAutomatically loads your flights in from your email and calendar, tracks delays, gate changes and has a live island at the top of your phone telling you where to go in different terminals.

\n\n\n\nAlso allows you to track flights of friends live and share your flight status with them.

\n\n\n\nBeyond a game changer, has saved me from missing a bunch of flights. No affiliation,[it just rules](\"https://click.convertkit-mail.com/e5ump202q8s7hlqod5ri7u863g022blhrzz5/g3hnh5hmmv4wlghr/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBzLmFwcGxlLmNvbS9nYi9hcHAvZmxpZ2h0eS1saXZlLWZsaWdodC10cmFja2VyL2lkMTM1ODgyMzAwOA==\").​
