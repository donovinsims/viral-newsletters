Hi friend,

I’m coming back to the UK!!

A special XL version of my solo live show will be happening in London on Thursday 28th November at the beautiful Eventim Apollo – home to the BBC’s Live At The Apollo!

This will be the biggest show I’ve ever done, and my only show in the UK at all this year.

Nervous, excited, thrilled, terrified, dialled. Everything. This is going to be wild!

Presale tickets go on sale next week, sign up to get first access now at [https://chriswilliamson.live/london](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u0ew6wrzi8hkmee84f2iz8850kku9/p8heh9hz6qegn6iq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jaHJpc3dpbGxpYW1zb24ubGl2ZS9sb25kb24= "https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u0ew6wrzi8hkmee84f2iz8850kku9/p8heh9hz6qegn6iq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jaHJpc3dpbGxpYW1zb24ubGl2ZS9sb25kb24=")

Onto what I’ve been thinking aboutâ¦

**Introverts don’t exist.**

Being social is effortless when you’re with the right people.

And mind numbing when you’re with the wrong ones.

**You’re probably not an introvert, your friends just suck.**

Even the most introverted person will want to stay late at dinner when the conversation is great.

Plus, since moving to America, I’ve realised how much introversion and extroversion are culturally dependant.

“An American introvert is an English extrovert.” â George Mack

So if you would be more extroverted if you’d been born in America, or in a more social family, or had a more outgoing friend group, what does it mean to say you ARE an introvert?

Stack on top of that if you’re not particularly fired up or interested by the people around you, or if you’re currently going through a Lonely Chapter where you’re outgrowing your old friends – of course you’re not going to feel particularly extroverted.

Don’t be gaslit by cultural conditioning and misaligned friends masquerading as intrinsic nature.

You’re probably not an introvert, your friends just suck.

Dr Anna Machin – why did love evolve in humans? What is its purpose? Why is it so hard to define and why does it come and go without us choosing it to? Such a great blend of Evolutionary Psychology and mating theory.

## **THINGS I’VE LEARNED**

1.  
**There may be limits to the roles men & women should fill.**

“If sex-realist feminists want culture and policy to acknowledge that women are more physiologically vulnerable in some contexts, we have to be willing to consider that in some *other* contexts this may constrain the roles that are open to women.

If the price of (say) keeping gender woo out of prisons, or reserving some intimate care roles for women, is that front-line combat roles should be reserved for men, this seems eminently reasonable to me.

If we’re going to be sex-realist, let’s be sex-realist across the board.” â Mary Harrington

If women would rather be with a bear in the woods than a man because of how physically formidable and aggressive men are, the question arises: how can a woman be expected to protect the very same greater-than-bear-danger-inducing animal (Donald J. Trump) that she wouldn’t be able to safely walk through a forest with?

2.  
**Shadowban Razor.**

Do not attribute to algorithmic manipulation that which can be explained by boring content.

Most people aren’t shadowbanned, their content just sucks.

3.  
**Two quotes on the Toothless Life.**

“I have led a toothless life.  
A toothless life.  
I have never bitten into anything.  
I was waiting.  
I was reserving myself for later onâand I have just noticed that my teeth have gone.” â Jean-Paul Sartre

&

“And then there is the most dangerous risk of all the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.” â Randy Komisar

## **LIFE HACK**

**Tour de France Unchained.**

Such an amazing documentary series on Netflix tracking the story of the 2022 and 2023 Tours.

A phenomenal insight into the motivation and suffering capacity of the best cyclists on the planet.

Highly recommended.  

Big love,
