Hi friend,

I’m on a plane over the Atlantic right now.

Just recorded a huge episode in Arizona which I can’t wait to drop.

Landing in London Monday morning ready for my live tour to start this week.

If you managed to snag a ticket earlier this year – I can’t wait to see you.

I’m also away from Austin for a full month touring and doing shows.

Pray for my sleeping pattern.

****I’ve had lots of people ask about the science & ingredients quality in Neutonic.****

​[Read the science here.](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/75u97w2wevh8hk3ekkgczhq0q4o66/g3hnh5h3e3k4qnsr/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV1dG9uaWMuY29tL3BhZ2VzL2luZ3JlZGllbnRz)​

Elon Musk was on Lex’s show recently.

“My mind is a storm.

I don’t think most people would want to be me.

They may think they would want to be me, but they don’t.

They don’t know, they don’t understand.”

****This is why jealousy is a stupid emotion.****

****In fact, envy is the only one of the seven deadly sins that doesn’t feel good.****

Here’s Naval on jealousy:

“I realised that all these people that I was jealous of, I couldn’t just cherry-pick and choose little aspects of their life.

I couldn’t say I want his body, I want her money, I want his personality.

You have to be that person.

Do you want to actually be that person with all of their reactions, their desires, their family, their happiness level, their outlook on life, their self-image?

If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100% swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.”

This seems obvious, but it’s so counterintuitive to how we all relate to the people we’re jealous of.

We look at the humans we admire as ubiquitous successes, a brilliant collage worthy of life-wide admiration and envy.

We presume that we could add in the elements of their life which we love like taking clothes off a rail, but that’s not how life works.

The outfit you’re imagining trying on is head-to-toe, not pick & choose.

****The price you’d need to pay to be the person you admire is probably one you would not foot the bill for.****

****This week’s upcoming episodes:****

Monday.  
Douglas Murray – 2 hours with one of my favourite humans on how to be brave, whether HSBC is right that women don’t need men, whether we’re past peak woke and so much more.

Thursday.  
Morgan Housel – my favourite writer on the timeless lessons from human psychology you need to know. Absolute spectacular. Go buy his new book too.

Saturday.  
Bryan Caplan – Bryan wrote a letter to his young daughter advising her to not be a feminist. What sort of father wouldn’t want this for his daughter? Where is he right and where could he be wrong?

## ****THINGS I’VE LEARNED****

1.  
​****Young Adults are doing worse than teenagers.****

“A recent report was released by the Harvard Graduate School of Education this past week, detailing the drivers of anxiety for young adults ages 18 to 25.

34% reported feelings of loneliness.

51% said achievement pressure negatively impacted their mental health.

And 58% reported lacking “meaning or purpose” in their lives the previous month.

50% reported that their mental health was negatively influenced by “not knowing what to do with my life.”

There has been much examination of the well-being of teens aged 14 to 17, not much has been known about those occupying these critical young adulthood years.

And yet, “young adults report roughly twice the rates of anxiety and depression as teens.”

The young adults are not OK.”

​

2.  
​****Why victimhood is so alluring.****

At ARC Forum in London last week I was reminded of why claiming oppressed status has become so prevalent.

Victimhood culture has arisen because the human system’s demand for challenges in life has outstripped the modern world’s ability to supply them.

Basically, if there is no crisis, people will create one themselves.

Then they can gain status by waging war against an imagined adversary.

Shadowboxing an inflated hegemon.

Having to compete on competence is difficult because your ability to be competent is limited by reality.

Whereas your ability to claim victimhood is bottomless.

​

​****Why I don’t like people who only ever criticise.****

“The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles, but to irrigate deserts.” — C.S. Lewis

​

## ****LIFE HACK****

****I’m gonna say it again. You don’t need hold luggage.****

I’m gonna try and do 4 weeks on just carry-on luggage.

May end up regretting this.

But I’m pretty sure that hold luggage is a psyop meant to keep you poor and late.

Big love,
