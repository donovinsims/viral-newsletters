Hi friend,

Here are some of the most important realisations I’ve come upon…

**1. You are not your thoughts.**
The voice that speaks in your head is not you.
You are the one who hears it speak.
Don’t identify with what your mind says any more than you identify with what someone on the street says.
This is one of the most liberating truths to know.

**2. Action is the antidote to anxiety.**
You’re not afraid of the future when you’re moving yourself toward it.
If you feel anxiety creeping in, use it as a trigger to lean into action, not stagnation.
Do something and you’ll feel better.

**3. Loneliness is a kind of tax you have to pay to atone for a certain complexity of mind.**
The weirder you are, the fewer people are like you, the fewer people will “get” you.
This is fine.

**4. Your weirdness is your competitive advantage.**
No one can beat you at being you.
Embrace your traumas, life experiences, scars, funny accent, whatever it is.
This is what sets you apart.
The weirder you are; the more unique you are; the more competitive & interesting you are.

**5. Joy has to be found today, not tomorrow.**
If you can’t be happy with a coffee, you won’t be happy with a yacht.
Choose to find joy in today, it’s there waiting for you.

**6. Never lie.**
Whether by omission or commission, lying degrades your virtue.
Your internal sense of self worth is keeping check, even if you aren’t.
Telling the truth is a superpower, it works for everything.
Start being radically honest today and your life will change.

**7. Keep promises to yourself.**
Your faith in your own word is vital.
Build it up by starting with small promises.
Say you’ll get up on time, say you’ll ring your parents.
Over time you can promise yourself bigger and bigger things.

**8. Most problems are easily fixed.**
90% of issues can be solved by a good sleep, a glass of water, a gym session, a walk outdoors or a chat with a friend.
Often you’ll find that low mood is accompanied by certain physical, habitual or environmental routines like staying in bed, being solitary, not eating or drinking well.
These are not a coping mechanism, they are a worsening mechanism.
Avoid them at all costs.

**9. You are the sky, everything else is just the weather.**
Your anger, frustration, anxiety & everything else is just a visitor in your mind.
Sometimes it gets cloudy so you can’t see the sun, but it’s always there if you just breathe and let go of what is holding the clouds in place.
Try and be angry for more than 5 minutes without constantly thinking about your anger, you can’t.
Realise that you are the architect of your own mood.

I do a podcast which has had 500 million+ downloads. You should subscribe on [Apple Podcasts](https://apple.co/2MNqIgw) or [Spotify](https://spoti.fi/2LSimPn).

**This week’s upcoming episodes:**
Monday. Mike Baker – former CIA guy and interesting geopolitical person gives his insights on Russia, AT&T’s outage, AI and what the future of warfare will look like.
Thursday. George TheTinMen – my favourite pro-men’s creator on male mental health, Drake’s dick pic, whether guys are shamed for their bodies and the reality of male reproductive rights. So so good.
Saturday. Noah Kagan – does money make you happy? What if you’ve interviews a ton of billionaires and asked them? Some great insights.

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED
1. **Women use o’s a lot.**
Adding the letter “o” to the word “so” is one of the strongest predictors that a social media user is female.
Among the words most disproportionately used by women online are “soo,” “sooo,” “soooo,” “sooooo,” and “soooooo.” — Rob Henderson

2. Why you can’t cope with certain people.
“High truth preference people can’t be friends with low truth preference people, because the former even with the best of intentions is prone to inadvertently offend the latter, whilst the latter consistently irritates and annoys the former with their dishonest denials and delusions.” — Illimitable Man

3. **A powerful question to unpack stress.**
“Whose opinion do I care about more than my own?” — Alex Hormozi
