Hi friend,

My live tour starts this Thursday in NYC.

5 shows are already sold out – NYC, Austin, Boston, Denver & Chicago all have very limited space left.

Last chance for tickets at [http://chriswilliamson.live/](http://chriswilliamson.live/)

I recently came across a blog post from Sam Altman about how to not care what other people think. It’s definitely worth reading.

> “A founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people think. I didn’t have an answer, and after reflecting on it more, I think it’s the wrong question.
>
> Almost everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it’s probably important.
>
> Caring too much makes you a sheep.
>
> But you need to be at least a little in tune with others to do something useful for them.
>
> It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on.
>
> Most people figure out the former but the latter doesn’t seem to get much attention.
>
> The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldn’t value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters).
>
> But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other people’s opinions on a very long time horizon—as long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong.
>
> You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do.
>
> A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet.
>
> But there are lots of other ways–the key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness.
>
> You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved.” — Sam Altman

## MODERN WISDOM

I do a podcast where I pretend to have a British accent.

**This week’s upcoming episodes:**

*   **Monday.** Bugzy Malone – one of my favourite episodes of the year. Amazing stories about a ruthless upbringing, the rap game, crime, psychology, motivation and more. Listen now on [Spotify](https://spotify.fi/2LSimPn) and [Apple Podcasts](https://apple.co/2MNqIgw).
*   **Thursday.** Sen. Bernie Sanders – not a joke. Recording today in NYC so I have no idea what we’ll talk about. But it’ll be big.
*   **Saturday.** Eliezer Yudkowsky – “if anyone builds it, everyone dies.” How Superintelligent AI could be the end of us all. Scary, prescient, important.

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1. **Left-wing authoritarians are less likely to support physically strong men as leaders.**

The University of Arkansas found that political ideology predicts how people judge male leaders based on physical strength:

*   Conservatives, especially men, were more likely to support physically strong men as leaders.
*   Left-wing authoritarians were less likely to do so, showing an aversion to muscular male leaders.
*   Across all participants, stronger-looking men were perceived as more conservative, even though their actual politics were unknown.

Researchers suggest this reflects evolved stereotypes: strength signals dominance, hierarchy, and enforcement — values conservatives admire but egalitarian authoritarians reject.

2. **Denial or identification, pick your direction.**

*   73% of Boomer males: “No matter what psychological challenges I face, I will not let them define me.”
*   72% of Gen Z females: “Mental illness is an important part of my identity.”

3. **The American education system needs some work.**

> “One in 5 American adults is illiterate.
>
> 54% of adults read below a sixth-grade level.
>
> And the numbers are getting worse.
>
> Relatedly, it is alarming how bad so many college-educated adults are at reading.” — Rob Henderson

## LIFE HACK

**LMNT Lemonade Salt is back in stock.**

This stuff is phenomenal and was sold out for ages.

They had a $1.6M truckload of it stolen recently (no joke).

But it’s available now, so go get it.

I keep harping on about LMNT because it really works – try it and feel the difference that proper, tasty hydration makes.

They also offer an unlimited duration money-back guarantee – so you can buy it 100% risk-free.

Try LMNT Risk-Free with a free sample pack. [https://drinklmnt.com/modernwisdom](https://drinklmnt.com/modernwisdom)
