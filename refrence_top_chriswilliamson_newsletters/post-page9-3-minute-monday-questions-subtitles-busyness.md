Hi friend,

My brand new 3+ hour episode is live with Dr Jordan Peterson, listen now on[Apple Podcasts](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/v8u9rgl873frhxmp2d6ughzrzkmll/g3hnh5h3e4lk8otr/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBsZS5jby8yTU5xSWd3)or[Spotify](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/v8u9rgl873frhxmp2d6ughzrzkmll/48hvhehr04pndrbx/aHR0cHM6Ly9zcG90aS5maS8yTFNpbVBu).

I’ve been reflecting on a lot of Morgan Housel’s work since recording with him a few weeks ago.

“The best measure of wealth is what you have minus what you want, and by this measure some billionaires are broke.”

So good.

**In homage, here are a list of difficult questions to ask yourself from Morgan.**

Whose life do I admire that is secretly miserable?

What do I believe is true only because believing it puts me in good standing with my tribe?

Which of my current values would be different if I were raised by different parents?

What do I believe the most with the least amount of evidence of it being true?

Who has the right answer but I ignore because they’re a bad communicator?

Who is full of it but I pay attention to because they’re a good communicator?

What do I think is ambition (a good trait) but is actually envy (a terrible one)?

What annoys me about other people that I sometimes do myself?

How much of my nostalgia is a false or incomplete memory of the past?

What in your profession is impossible to know no matter how smart you become? David Deutsch said, “Beware of the difference between prediction and prophecy. Prophecy purports to know things which cannot be known.”

Is this thing I’m worried about actually a problem, or am I looking for problems to worry about because they make me feel in control?

What in my field do I think is a law (works all the time) but is actually just a rule (works some of the time)?

What do I think is a universal truth but is actually just a norm unique to my own culture?

What was true a generation ago that no longer is, and who is clinging to that old truth?

What is partially true but I believe in it so absolutely, and take it so seriously, that I’ve turned it into a dangerous belief?

Are there things going well in my life today that I will look back on and wish I had quit while I was ahead?

Is there something in my life I think I’m “passionate” about or “focused” on but I’m actually just addicted to it?

Do I spend more time defending what I already know instead of trying to learn something new?

Are there people in my life who I consider kind and compassionate but they’re actually just too shy to tell me hard truths?

What would Instagram look like if it were an honest reflection of people’s life, instead of a curated highlight reel?

Am I being as nice as I could be, rather than just as nice as I need to be?

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1.
​**50% of Americans watch content with subtitles most of the time.**

When asked what their main reason is for using subtitles:

55% say it is harder to hear dialogue in shows and movies than it used to be.

Nearly 3 in 4 respondents claimed muddled audio from their content.

61% use them when accents are difficult to understand.

29% prefer to watch their content at home quietly, leaving subtitles on so as not to disturb roommates or family.

27% of Americans rely on subtitles to keep them focused on what they are watching while juggling the distractions of multiple screens, children, pets, work, the news, and more.

Nearly 1 in 5 regularly use subtitles in order to learn a new language.

With the overall preference for using subtitles growing, some Americans think they should be used by default, instead of having to opt in. Of our respondents, 32% think subtitles should be the default on streaming services and cable TVs, while 26% think they should be the default at movie theatres.

2.
​**5 priorities to remember.**

“Don’t ignore your dreams.
Don’t work too much.
Say what you think.
Cultivate friendships.
Be happy.” — Paul Graham

​

3.
​**Why you love being so busy.**

“Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.” — Oliver Burkeman

​

## LIFE HACK

**Kindle Oasis on Airplane Mode.**

I love my Kindle Oasis and the battery is great, but could be better.

Presuming you don’t need to download new content, turning it to Airplane Mode essentially turns it into a perpetual energy machine with unlimited battery.

Big love,
