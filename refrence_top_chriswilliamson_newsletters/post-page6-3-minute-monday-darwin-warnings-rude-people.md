****Charles Darwin was unsure whether he should get married so he made a list.****

The document has two columns, one labeled Marry, one labeled Not Marry, and above them, circled, are the words “This is the Question.”

On the pro-marriage side of the equation were “Children—(if it Please God)—Constant companion, (&friend in old age) who will feel interested in one,—object to be beloved & played with.”

After reflection of unknown length, he modified the foregoing sentence with “better than a dog anyhow.”

He continued: “Home, & someone to take care of house—Charms of music & female chitchat—These things good for one’s health.—but terrible loss of time.”

Without warning, Darwin had, from the pro-marriage column, swerved uncontrollably into a major anti-marriage factor, so major that he underlined it.

This issue—the infringement of marriage on his time, especially his work time—was addressed at greater length in the appropriate, Not Marry column.

Not marrying, he wrote, would preserve “Freedom to go where one like—choice of Society & little of it.—Conversation of clever men at clubs—not forced to visit relatives, & to bend in every trifle—to have the expense & anxiety of children—Perhaps quarreling—Loss of time.—cannot read in the Evening—fatness & idleness—Anxiety & responsibility—less money for books &—if many children forced to gain one’s bread.”

Even experts in mating and evolution struggle with big decisions.

****This week’s upcoming episodes:****

Monday.

Thursday.  
Rory Stewart – the host of 3 of the UK’s top 10 podcasts joins me to talk about the state of modern Britain, political incompetence, immigration problems and how to fix extreme poverty.

Saturday.

## ****THINGS I’VE LEARNED****

1.  
​****The duality of warning men about bad behaviour.****

“The problem with giving men advice like “don’t be pushy” is that the men who really need to hear it won’t listen, and the men who’d benefit from being more assertive will take it straight to heart.” — @ellegist

2.  
​****Rude people are stupid people.****

“A useful thing Twitter taught me is that rude people are almost always stupid.

In virtually every case, when someone viciously insults me for something I said, they also misunderstood what I said.

This makes sense, because rudeness and stupidity share a root cause: carelessness.” — Gurwinder Bhogal

3.  
​****If you’re so smart, why aren’t you happy?****

“The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.” — Naval

## ****LIFE HACK****

****Call your mum.****

You know you probably need to do it.

She’ll appreciate it and so will you.

Big love,
