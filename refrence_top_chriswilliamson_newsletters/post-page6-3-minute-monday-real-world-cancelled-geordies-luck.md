**The internet is not the real world.**

If you were to plot people’s political views on a graph, the distribution would probably look something like this:

![](https://chriswillx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-1.jpg)

Most people agree on most moderate opinions, with gradually ever fewer people out on the extremes.

“Having a strong military is important to a well-functioning country” – moderate agreement.

“Jewish space lasers started the Maui fires” – low agreement.

Maybe there would be some little clustered bumps, but I think it’s reasonable to assume this would be pretty accurate.

I think this graph would also map nicely onto a degree of certainty – with most people becoming less certain about accuracy as the position became more extreme.

But if you were to plot the positions posted by by people online, and their degree of certainty in them, I’m betting it would look like this:

Sure, the absolute extreme opinions are not as commonly posted because they’re so outrageous as to immediately disqualify the user as a crazy person.

But almost no one is speaking about mild positions.

Almost no one is speaking in caveated, hedged, uncertain terms.

The incentives online cause normal people to become extreme and extreme people to become the norm.

This goes beyond individual shitposting users and into legacy and new media too.

We have U-shaped news representing bell-curve beliefs.

The internet is not the real world.

## MODERN WISDOM

I do a podcast where I pretend to have a British accent.

**This week’s upcoming episodes:**

Monday.  
Alex Hormozi – another absolute banger. 3.5 hours of some fantastic insights into human nature, psychology, resilience, courage and more. Absolute must-listen.

Thursday.  
Dan Martell – how can you buy back your time? What are the most effective ways to use your money to increase your quality of life personally and professionally. Super in-depth, I loved this one.

Saturday.  
Rudyard Lynch – is there a coming Right-Wing rebellion? Was The Unabomber right? Is the male sexlessness issue really that big of a problem?

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1.  
**Cancel Culture comes for Geordie language.**

Newcastle University has suggested staff stop using the Geordie greeting “pet” after it was deemed off-limits in an equality and inclusion toolkit.

The 7-page guide advised “avoiding patronising or gendered terms” such as “girls”, “pet”, or “ladies”.

In the guide, there is also a glossary of 44 terms of genders and sexual orientations.

This includes terms to describe those who identify as having at least two gender identities, explaining what “agender”, “gender-variant” and “bigender” mean.

The guide, which was produced by 13 members of an inclusion team, has also listed terms they believe to be “incredibly sexist”, such as “man up” and “bossy”.

2.  
**How to be more lucky.**

Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine.

They tend to take the same route to and from work, interact with the same social circles, and talk to the same types of people at parties.

In contrast, lucky people tend to introduce lots of variety into their lives.

Relatedly, as Ada Yeo writes, “collect as many lottery tickets as you can.” — Rob Henderson

3.  
**If you can’t say “no” easily, you can’t be trusted.**

If I can’t trust your no, how can anyone trust your yes? — Joe Hudson

## LIFE HACK

**Use your driving time to reflect.**

An old one but still such a banger.

Don’t put a podcast or music on in the car for a few drives each week when you’re on your own and see where your mind goes.

There’s something really great about the reflective environment created by a bit of your brain focussing on driving while the rest of your brain is given time to think about whatever comes to the surface.

Washing the dishes is actually an even better ROI for me.

Big love,
