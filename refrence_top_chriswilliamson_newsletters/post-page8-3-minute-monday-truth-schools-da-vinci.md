Hi friend,

“You should “just be yourself” not because it will make you more likeable (it won’t) but because it’s only by being yourself that you’ll find people who like you for who you really are rather than for someone you’re pretending to be.” — Gurwinder Bhogal

This was one of the biggest realisations of my 20’s.

The advantage of doing this is that no criticism will ever fully land because you’re one degree removed from the person who’s being criticised.

The disadvantage is that you’re removed from the person who’s being complimented too.

**If you’re only playing a role, you will never feel connected to the successes of your life.**

Any accolades or warmth you receive won’t resonate properly in your heart because it’s not YOU who is receiving it, it’s the character you’re pretending to be.

“The persona is incapable of receiving love, it can only receive praise.” — Aubrey Marcus

This is how you can feel alone in a crowd and hollow in victory.

If you haven’t shown your true self to the people around you, you are inevitably going to feel disconnected from them.

And the people who would have fallen in love with the true you will pass you by because that person is never presented.

The persona subsumes the person.

This isn’t the people around you’s fault.

Take responsibility.

**There are reasons to fear truly showing up, but they pale in insignificance compared to the reasons to hide away.**

Even if all you want is success, your highest point of unique contribution is you fully embracing you.

“No one can beat you at being you.” — Naval Ravikant

The absolute best you can hope for if you’re playing a role is to be the 2nd best in the world at being someone else.

## THINGS I’VE LEARNED

1. ​ **Illinois schools are not good.**

“A study of Illinois public schools in 2022 found that ZERO students passed the state math proficiency test at 53 Illinois public schools (almost all of whom are majority-black).

For reading, it’s 30 schools.

At one such school — a “prep school” designed to prepare students for medical careers — the per student spending is $47,000.

And only 1 out of 10 kids or less can do math at grade level in 930 schools… that’s more than a quarter of all schools in the state.” — h/t EricsElectrons

​

2. ​ **Segal’s Law.**

“A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with 2 watches is never sure.”

Ancient societies followed a single narrative. Modern societies are cacophonies of competing narratives. Without trust, more data doesn’t make us more informed but more confused. — Gurwinder Bhogal

​

3. ​ **Da Vinci can also paint.**

“At one point he’s writing a job application letter, right, when he’s reaching that very scary milestone of turning 30.

He writes a job application letter to the Duke of Milan, it’s 11 paragraphs.

The first 10 are all he can do in engineering, in invention.

Says, ‘I can invent portable bridges, I can make great public buildings, I can divert water, I can make military weapons.’

Only in the very last paragraph he says, ‘I can also paint.’” — Walter Isaacson

​

## LIFE HACK

**Tell the truth.**

The more I focus on this, the better my life gets.

The more truth I tell, the less afraid I am, and the more my life improves.

Tell the truth. ​

Big love, Chris x
