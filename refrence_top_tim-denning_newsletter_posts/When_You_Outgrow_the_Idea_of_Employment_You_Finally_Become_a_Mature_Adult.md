The modern workplace is a daycare.

Think about it. They offer you free food and coffee. They give you a locker to put your bag in. The office has white walls and plain furniture. Everyone typically starts and finishes work at the same time.

But here’s the hidden sign of a daycare: personal emergencies.

When you work a job and your dog dies, the boss says “take a load off.” If you have a snotty nose or a minor cough, you can have a sick day. If you feel stressed or overwhelmed, your boss will try and help.

If you miss a deadline or a deliverable, you can make up endless excuses and probably get away with it. When things go wrong you can blame other departments or the customer and it’s normal. No one bats an eye.

Workplaces are daycares in disguise because they nanny you and let you get away with so much. Your mind is coddled and watered down into believing this is the way the world works.

This daycare life causes massive harm that you only realize later in life.

# Why employers must pretend to show compassion

Employers don’t tell you to take a day off or help you destress because they like you.

They do it because they must show compassion, or risk damaging their employer brand. Once that’s damaged they can’t attract new talent.

Being seen to be doing the right thing is what runs the world. But underneath all the fake “thoughts and prayers” vibes and changing of company logos to whatever flag is in fashion, there’s the cold hard truth…

Businesses exist to make profit any way they can.

This fact is revealed if you pay attention. When layoffs strike workplace daycares drown their precious little employee babies. They fire people, downsize, cut bonuses, remove perks (like ping pong tables) and behead so-called untouchable leaders.

So it’s a weird yin and yang. On the one hand, you can be an employee and experience compassion and the easy life, but on the other hand, if you overindulge in the daycare perks, you end up laid off and asking AI to assess your job application for the next company that can do the same.

# The idea of employment makes you less mature

I’m not here to bash jobs.

Everyone, including me, starts with a job. We need people to have jobs for the global economy to function.

My point is that a job is a stepping stone. It’s like puberty. You want to go through it but you don’t still want to be a pimply pubescent teenager at the age of 65.

The point of employment is to outgrow it.

One of my best friends is an employee, but it makes me sad though.

He has so much talent and potential, yet he just sounds immature when he talks about economics, business, or money.

The other day he said to me “We’re thinking of having a second kid, and I’m going to get paternity leave again!” He nearly pissed his pants.

See the problem? Paternity leave is 12 weeks off work. It equals about $10,000 for him. The workplace daycare mentality has made him get excited about taking 12 weeks off and getting paid for it.

He’s entitled too. He thinks he deserves this perk. He can’t see it’s a handout and it comes with strings attached known as golden handcuffs.

What’s weird is that having a second baby is hardly a holiday. If you’re staying at home with a newborn for 12 weeks, you’re going to be covered in sh*t, piss, and vomit.

12 weeks of paid leave isn’t something a mature adult would trade their dreams in for.

We don’t start out with this level of immaturity. But if we stay at a traditional job for too long, it starts to program us to think and act like an adult toddler. And to value stupid perks like a few weeks off, or free pizza and beer.

# The lie of job security is another sign of immaturity

When I talk to people about starting a business or being a contractor, consultant or freelancer, they usually tell me they’ll stay at their job for the time being because it’s safer.

That decision is never short term. They’ve been saying that for decades.

More importantly, the idea of a job being safe is now a common joke that I used to also believe. Jobs are the least safe path in life. Layoff culture changed that forever.

Firing low performers is the norm. Mass layoffs in recessions are the norm. Hiring people using AI that can discriminate based on race, age, or gender is the norm.

What’s safer is to have multiple customers (a.k.a employers). You’ll rarely hear about that though. It’s not common knowledge yet but word is spreading slowly.

It’s immature to think a job is safe. If you don’t do what you’re told or someone better comes along, you will be fired. Guaranteed.

Remember: if you got hit by a bus tomorrow and died, they’d have your job filled in a few weeks and your boss wouldn’t even come to your funeral. Within a month no one would remember you. The business would carry on.

# The real world of one-person businesses humbles you fast

The opposite of a workplace daycare is a one-person business or a startup with a team.

Building a startup with a team of people isn’t for everyone. But running a one-person business is much more achievable.

Mature adults often start out as employees and then progress to selling their skills and experience to multiple businesses at the same time. This is slowly becoming the future of the workforce.

At the last bank I worked at more than half of the staff were contractors or consultants – and Australia is not exactly progressive.

With a one-person business there are no perks. No paternity leave, no free beer and pizza, no sick days, and most of all, no excuses.

You must show up. You must add value. As soon as you stop doing those two things, you get emails with “we longer require your services.”

It’s a different level of maturity. Nobody is coming to save you. It’s just you against the world. So you mature faster. If you bring the workplace daycare mentality to a one-person business, you get humbled fast.

You quickly see no one gives a flying f*ck about your personal emergencies or your sniffle. You either add value or you’re a goner. “I’m off on holiday for 8 weeks” doesn’t work in the one-person business world. The out-of-office message doesn’t work either.

This means you must learn how to balance your personal life and your business. That makes you smarter and forces you to put processes in place.

You go from being a needy, desperate toddler employee… to a high agency individual who can hunt, kill, and eat by themselves. That shift in personality slowly makes you 10x wealthier than any employee could ever be.

You learn to roll with the smacks in the head instead of needing self-care days every week to deal with modern life.

I found that when I quit being an employee, I became more resilient. I could handle more disasters. And I could stay calm under pressure.

# “Maturity comes when you realize your security depends on your ability to solve problems, not your ability to find someone else to solve them for you.”

My friend Matt Gray smashed me in the balls with this quote.

The key differentiator in life that separates successful from unsuccessful people, or wealthy versus poor people is the ability to solve problems.

When customers would blow up at my last job I could bring in the team or ask my boss to step in. I always had a safety blanket and a pink bear to cuddle.

When I became an entrepreneur that all went away. If problems happened I had to solve them. In 2021 I learned this the hard way. I had $1.2M stolen from my digital wallet. I had already quit my banking job by then.

I panicked and tried to recover the funds. It didn’t work. 2 hours after it happened I had to run a workshop. I couldn’t cancel. I had no boss to call. My work colleagues didn’t come to my house or send me flowers.

I was all alone. Nobody gave a f*ck.

I had two choices: 1) walk in front of a train 2) solve the problem and move on.

So I took option two. I owned the problem. I put a plan in place to make all the money back again. And I had coffee with a wise friend to reset my mindset.

It was my ability to solve problems that saved me. It gave me the opportunity to make money again and have a second go at wealth.

# Ownership versus permission-seeking will save your life

Employment is immature because you have to ask for permission, and you likely own nothing – no equity and not even the problems.

Asking for permission when you’re 20-something is fine. Once you get past 30 it starts to get old. The path of a one-person business means you transition from being a renter of someone else’s dream to an owner.

It feels a bit like when you go from renting a home to owning one. On paper it’s the same house, but when you own your home, you feel differently.

Most employees have never felt the incredible gift of ownership. They just go from day to day asking for permission and getting paid less than they’re worth because they have no ownership of anything. It makes me sad.

# True freedom feels better than a high-paying salary

My old boss is the exception to the rule.

He makes close to $1M a year. It’s not what it seems though. He lives in a massive house in a fancy suburb here in Australia. His 4 kids go to private school. He drives a Range Rover. He needs a high salary to maintain this lifestyle.

When he got laid off he had 90 days to find another job or he’d be in financial hardship. So he took a job working at a dinosaur (almost dead) 90s tech company.

I told him to downgrade his lifestyle. He was okay to do it but his wife and kids refused. They’re friends and family are used to his current status. If he were to move to a cheap suburb they’d judge him. Certain friends would stop hanging out with him. He wouldn’t be welcome at the golf club anymore.

That ego death is just not something he can ever do.

So he’s stuck on the hamster wheel to nowhere screaming “I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy” while wasting his potential and representing a company that most of us wouldn’t even piss on.

The path of a one-person business isn’t about more money. It’s about having choices, ownership, and ultimately, freedom.

We think we want more money. What we really want deep down is freedom – blank calendar, time with family, and being unrushed.

# It’s impossible to be employed again once you’ve tasted entrepreneurship

That feels weird to say.

I always thought I might go back to a job one day for some fun. Now, I could never do that. The rewards suck way too hard. The effect employment has on your psychology becomes a form of mental illness.

I don’t ever want to be coddled with woke workplace culture and fake “thoughts and prayers” vibes again.

I prefer when businesses are honest and admit they exist for profit & will do nothing about foreign wars, and leave them to the military and politicians. I prefer when opportunities are attainable based on merit, not looking good. Life is simpler that way.

Entrepreneurship is simple but not easy. Impossible to regret it though. You don’t have to be a startup founder. But to ignore the opportunity of being a one-person business is naive.

Ownership is what makes you mature. Become an owner.
