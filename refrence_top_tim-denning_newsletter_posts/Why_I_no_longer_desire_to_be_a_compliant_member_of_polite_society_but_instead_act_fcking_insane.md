# Why I no longer desire to be a compliant member of polite society but instead act f*cking insane

### I stopped being polite. I stopped complying. And it changed everything — here’s how you can do it too.

I wanted people to like me so badly.

I wore a suit, shined my black dress shoes, and smiled for strangers. I even got on stages to give fake speeches about how much I loved banking.

If management asked me to do something brainless, I’d do it. When I was single, if a woman asked me to do something stupid or get drunk with her, I complied.

The madness got so ridiculous, I spent 6 months trying to connect with a dude in Silicon Valley so I could get an invite to Richard Branson’s island. When I look back on that one act alone, I feel stupid.

Why the f*ck did I want a selfie with Branson?

The dude meets so many people every year, he wouldn’t remember little old Tim Denning from Australia with his tiny business ideas. LOL.

When you work in banking you must be more compliant than normal. It’s a highly regulated industry. You’re dealing with people’s money. One wrong move and you can be banished from the industry forever.

This made me live in fear.

It’s a spectacular form of control. In the last 12 months, the control where I live has gotten worse. In Australia, I can now face criminal charges based on what I say online. It’s bred a new era of compliance.

People are petrified to say what they think, even though the threat is small. Unless you’re telling people to burn down parliament you’ll probably be fine.

But compliance isn’t always based on rules. It’s based on perceived threats.

As long as people feel threatened, they’ll comply. And they’ll comply with whatever BS rules are stuffed down their underpants.

A few years ago a switch flipped in my head.

I looked back on my life. All the compliance, politeness, and people-pleasing got me nowhere. I had no money. I hated my job. My friends were boring. People used and abused me. I worked long hours. I never saw my partner. I couldn’t even afford to buy a basic home in Australia to raise a family.

Life sucked. The strategy wasn’t working.

So I started doing the opposite. I just didn’t care anymore.

I wanted to act f*cking insane. I wanted to be weird. I didn’t want to fit in. I wanted to speak my mind. I wanted to push boundaries. I wanted to earn what I was worth.

The moment this transformation popped into my head, I was never the same again. The first sign of a new era was when a bad neighbor did the wrong thing.

I moved into a new home. The neighbor over the road was a charitable organisation. They played loud music over a PA until late into the night. 5 out of every 7 days. Typical duration could be anywhere from 8-10 hours.

I asked them to tone it down. Their first response: “We’re a charity so we can do whatever the hell we want.”

What?!!!

I told them I would get the council involved. They didn’t care. I went more and more insane. They said, “You shouldn’t have bought a house next to the equivalent of an airport.”

It made no sense to me. Laws prevent people carrying on this way. I eventually learned they were above the law. They’d been breaking laws for years and getting away with it.

Worse, they bragged about getting away with it.

A war started forming in my mind. I got 120 neighbors involved. I emailed every TV and radio station in Australia. We had live news outside of their building. They still didn’t listen. I then took them through the legal system.

Through a bizarre turn of events, the judge we got was an ex-member of their organisation. He ruled in their favor even though they were breaking the law. I had to settle. The charity agreed to tone it down.

They didn’t.

I kept going. They called me insane. I got them threatened with a public health order. They were days away from big fines. They finally woke up after 2 years of me trying. I haven’t seen them misbehaving for almost a year.

The neighbors think I’m some sort of unhinged rebel from a 3rd-world country. They think I have a screw loose.

Being polite gets you nowhere.

The old polite version of me would have run themselves into the ground and let these bastards run amok and ruin my sleep. The insane guy doesn’t do that anymore.

Once you exit polite society and go a little insane, you’re never the same again. It shows up in every aspect of life.

I was in an Apple store recently trying to buy two Mac screens.

I walk in. Nobody comes up to me. Every staff member ignores me. So I get a little impatient. I walk up to a staff member.

“I need to buy some screens. Can you help?”

What happens next shocks me.

“Sorry sir, everything in this store is by appointment now. Shall I book you in? It’s about a 30 minute wait.”

My face went red. I had a hungry 2 year old who wouldn’t sit still. 30 minutes is like 24 hours in a toddler’s brain. But I didn’t abuse the staff member because they were just doing their job and following orders.

> Me: “Who made this decision?”Staff member: “The store manager.”Me: “Can you get me the store manager?”

Me: “Who made this decision?”

Staff member: “The store manager.”

Me: “Can you get me the store manager?”

5 mins later a guy in black-framed glasses with a smart ass smile comes over. I ask him “Did you make this Apple store appointment only?”

“Yes.”

The quiet, polite Tim disappears.

> “This is outrageous. Steve Jobs designed these stores to be open and friendly. Customers are supposed to be able to freely approach staff members. His vision was no lines and lots of helpful staff. He’d be rolling in his grave if he saw what you’ve done in this store. I own Apple stock. I feel like I should sell it all right now. This company is going to hell if this is the new norm. Samsung doesn’t do this. What happened to the original Apple? I’m embarrassed. This is a disgrace.”

Samsung doesn’t do this. What happened to the original Apple? I’m embarrassed. This is a disgrace.”

As I loudly gave my speech Martin Luther King style, a small crowd formed around me. People were enjoying the show. The look on their faces was, “This guy is saying exactly what we all think but are too scared to say.”

When I finished making my point, a husband and wife started clapping, and others followed. I then left the store with my kiddo and bought what I needed online.

When you see ludicrous situations and say nothing, you only create more ludicrously. You become complicit in the crime.

In case you’re thinking “This Tim guy is an a**hole,” there’s an important fact you need to know. The goal isn’t to abuse people or take cheap shots at them to stroke your precious ego.

The goal is to say what you think with respect.

The older I get the more I’m realizing acting insane is the only way.

Because the alternative is to be a compliant little sheep who gets walked all over and suffers from poverty and a lack of freedom as a result. It makes no sense.

And I’m not standing for it any longer.

Polite Tim used to be desperate to please people. That drove me to follow stupid rules created by stupid people and comply with every request. An idea I saw on social media changed all of that:

> “There is no reason to be a people pleaser. People are never pleased.”

“There is no reason to be a people pleaser. People are never pleased.”

When you’re polite and comply to impress others, they always want more. You never satisfy their level of required compliance. So you feel like you’re never enough. It’s a painful way to live. It’s a form of modern slavery.

The world is becoming crazier. More rules. More of a gap between rich and poor. More tyrants. More powerful institutions pretending to do good while doing evil.

If you don’t speak up you eventually lose your voice.

You start complying with the most ridiculous ideas. I’m still trying to get over what it was like to be in a bat virus lockdown here in Australia for more than 2 years.

I can’t believe I complied. I became a caged animal. I lost all my freedom.

This is what happens when good people don’t say what they think. When good people comply with senseless rules out of fear, they become controlled. All you really have if you strip away the money and possessions is your freedom.

Once you lose that you end up with nothing.

When I was a compliant member of polite society, I wanted to impress everyone. Now I don’t want to impress anyone at all. I couldn’t think of anything worse. Impressing people feels like slavery.

What’s cooler is to be unhinged and act totally insane.
