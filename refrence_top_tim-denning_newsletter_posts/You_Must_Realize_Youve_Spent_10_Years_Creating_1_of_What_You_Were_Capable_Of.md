The average person never reaches 99% of their potential.

It’s not their fault… they’re just unaware of all the things they could do. They got stuck settling for second best and thinking they’d done enough in life.

If you’re reading this then you’re probably built differently. You’ve probably already realized you can do or be more. Or you may have already made the jump.

Zach Pogrob inspired the headline of this essay. He reminds us: we’re capable of so much more no matter how much we’ve already achieved.

Once we understand that idea at a deep level, it’s like seeing life as a video game, and you have all the cheat codes. Possibilities become limitless. Your mind is rewired for the rest of your life.

Let’s go down the rabbit hole.

# Here’s the bizarre reason why most people never reach their potential

Victoria was driven. Then her boyfriend’s car went under a truck at 100 mph.

Only a day before the accident I told him to stop driving fast after he nearly smashed into my car at the gym. I had no idea I’d given him a death wish.

The next day he was driving fast, alone. A truck did an illegal turn at the bottom of a steep hill. He couldn’t see the truck as his V8 muscle car screamed over the hill. By the time he saw the truck it was too late.

The truck decapitated his car and sliced the roof off clean.

Victoria was dating the boy. I was friends with them both. She wanted to be a singer. She had just got her big break on one of those singing tv competitions. Her boyfriend dying was a blessing. She got even more focused on her goal and went for it.

After the tv show finished she tried to get a record deal. The record labels rejected her. She took the first rejection well. But after 10 rejections in a row it got to her. She wanted the world to see her talent and for that to be enough.

It wasn’t.

6 months later she stopped going after her singing dream. The disappointment ruined a lifetime of fun in music. What went wrong?

* She thought it would be easy
* Her timeframe for success was 6 months
* She couldn’t handle basic rejection
* She relied on talent, not effort
* She was too nice and didn’t fight back

She thought it would be easy

Her timeframe for success was 6 months

She couldn’t handle basic rejection

She relied on talent, not effort

She was too nice and didn’t fight back

Victoria’s short story illustrates perfectly why people never reach their potential. Every goal worth achieving is harder than we expect.

Adjusting our expectations is crucial or we hit a roadblock.

# 1. First comes bitter acceptance

If you pay close attention, you’ll notice most people are delusional in how they see themselves.

They delude themselves into thinking they’ve achieved more than they have. Or they pretend their big breakout moment has been years in the making and it’s days away.

They do everything they can to avoid learning the truth: they’ve spent years using 1% of their true potential. It’s an uncomfortable truth to face. It’s a truth I know well. I wasted 10 years in banking when I knew I should have been an entrepreneur.

I pretended the board meetings and endless client coffees were fun and that I was adding value. The bitter truth? The bank logo I worked for did most of the selling for me, and I did close to no real work.

Clients saying yes to our banking offers had nothing to do with me. Any banker could have rolled up with the same bank logo and made the deal.

As I write these words it hurts my ego a lot.

It hurts to know I wasted 10 years of my 20s and 30s (arguably the best years) doing mediocre work and drowning in comfort. The difference is in 2021 I decide to accept this bitter truth and fix the situation.

I stopped focusing on all the time I’d wasted, and started focusing on unlocking the other 99% of my potential through the internet.

Most people can’t accept the fact they’ve been playing it small because they have too much time/money/resources invested already to burn the boats and start again.

One idea will help you:

You first have to ruin your life before you change your life.

# 2. A traditional career won’t unlock your potential

This will be the most mind-blowing part of this essay for a lot of you.

The traditional career isn’t designed to unlock your potential. We’re taught to specialize in one skill and choose one income stream (normally a salary). By default this makes us comfortable and wires our brains to crave predictability.

But predictability is boring, and a single income is high risk.

Corporations also have little incentive to help us unlock our potential. It’s in their best interests to have us use one core skill and do it in a repeatable fashion so they can profit the most from it. Too many high achievers are bad for their business model.

This is why those people that I’ve seen unlock their full potential mix a traditional career with some sort of internet side project to push further.

Often, that internet project takes over the rest of their life at a crucial inflection point they can never see coming.

Avoid staying stuck in a traditional career.

# 3. Then comes unexpected courage

Courage isn’t a skill.

You get courage when you’ve finally had enough. You develop the habit of courage when you have a powerful reason to be courageous.

Courage is needed because every big goal that can unlock your potential is surrounded in failure and rejections.

My big goal of writing online to millions of people meant I had to piss off friends, accept family might read, lose career opportunities due to being larger than life, and cop a beating from strangers on the internet who wrote hit pieces on me.

The downsides were worth it. Being courageous is a feeling you’ll never regret. The feeling is so addictive it will alter the course of your life forever.

# 4. Now comes maniac-level action

"Without effort, your talent is nothing more than unmet potential. Without effort, your skill is nothing more than what you could have done but didn't." - Angela Duckworth

Your potential is found in the actions you haven’t taken.

It’s easy to drown in information and endlessly create plans of what you might do. The hardest option is just to take action and trust you’ll figure it out. This is a life skill society doesn’t possess.

It requires you to have high agency, which means to have a bias for action and make something happen from nothing.

Potential is unlocked when you do so much execution on your goal, people think you’re a maniac. Many of those actions you take will be a disaster or lead nowhere. But a handful of actions will act like a lighthouse that guides you in the right direction.

We don’t think our way to our potential. We act our way there.

Here’s what I mean…

When I started an online business I had no idea what I’d sell. For 5 years I didn’t solve this problem. But I sold so many different products and services that eventually the answer became obvious.

No book, mentor, or guru could have led me to that outcome. I had to find out for myself. I had to see what didn’t work to find out what I wanted to work on for the rest of my life.

Unlocking your potential is a process of elimination. Find out what doesn’t work through action to find out what does work.

# "Life is a suicide mission that you're treating like a training run”

( Zach Pogrob)

This is the most important part.

There has to be a big f*cking reason why you will unlock your potential, otherwise you would’ve done it already.

The best reason I can think of is that you’re not getting out of life alive. Our human nature helps us forget this fact. That’s why a cancer scare woke me the hell up and reminded me.

You don’t get to live again. There is only one chance. You will never be younger than right now. You’ll either make an impact on people or you won’t.

When your perception of time changes so, too, does the way you act. Let’s break how you see time forever (sorry not sorry).

You will live for roughly 4000 weeks. That’s 960 months. Wasting even 12 months now seems like a terrible life decision – you’re welcome.

The problem is you think you have time. You don’t. Today is the day, not tomorrow. Let’s finish with this idea from Leo Khoury:

“The greatest tragedy in life is not death but a life that never realized its full potential.”
